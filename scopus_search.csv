85107181906,An easy-to-use function to assess deep space radiation in human brains,Khaksarighiri S.,NA,Scientific Reports,11,1,NA,10.1038/s41598-021-90695-5,"Health risks from radiation exposure in space are an important factor for astronauts’ safety as they venture on long-duration missions to the Moon or Mars. It is important to assess the radiation level inside the human brain to evaluate the possible hazardous effects on the central nervous system especially during solar energetic particle (SEP) events. We use a realistic model of the head/brain structure and calculate the radiation deposit therein by realistic SEP events, also under various shielding scenarios. We then determine the relation between the radiation dose deposited in different parts of the brain and the properties of the SEP events and obtain some simple and ready-to-use functions which can be used to quickly and reliably forecast the event dose in the brain. Such a novel tool can be used from fast nowcasting of the consequences of SEP events to optimization of shielding systems and other mitigation strategies of astronauts in space.",0,2021-12-01,Article,Secretaría de Educación Pública

While on Earth we are protected from space radiation by our planet's magnetic field, on such deep space voyages astronauts will be exposed to high energy particles from solar flares and galactic cosmic rays (GCR). This exposure carries risks to the central nervous system (CNS) that could jeopardize the mission and astronaut health. Earth-bound studies have employed a variety of single-beam and sequential radiation exposures to simulate the effects of GCR exposure in rodents. Multiple studies have shown that GCR simulation induces a maladaptive activation of microglia – the brain-resident immune cells. GCR simulation also induced synaptic changes resulting in lasting cognitive and behavioral defects. Female and male mice show different susceptibilities to GCR exposure, and evidence suggests this sexually dimorphic response is linked to microglia. Manipulating microglia can prevent the development of cognitive deficits in male mice exposed to components of GCR. This discovery may provide clues towards how to protect astronauts’ cognitive and behavioral health both during deep space missions and upon return to Earth.",0,2021-07-01,Review,National Institutes of Health
85103575389,Aging-like metabolic and adrenal changes in microgravity: State of the art in preparation for Mars,Strollo F.,Bed-rest | Cortisol | Glucose | Insulin | Mars | Space | Stress,Neuroscience and Biobehavioral Reviews,126,NA,236-242,10.1016/j.neubiorev.2021.01.028,"Endocrine and metabolic changes that typically accompany aging on Earth have been consistently observed in space. Support for the role of gravity in aging has mostly come from ground simulation studies in head down bed rest. However, uncertainties remain and have to be resolved in planning for the ambitious enterprise of sending humans to Mars and back. Stress-related corticosteroid changes and metabolic adaptation to microgravity and their relationship with aging are the object of the present review mostly, albeit of course non exclusively, coming from the personal experience of the authors. The picture coming out of it is that of some, not easily proven, stress-induced cortisol increase accompanied by insulin resistance, both of which represent typical aging-like phenomena mediated by chronic low-grade inflammation. This suggests the need for humans to consider the long journey to safely land, live and work on Mars by taking advantage of integrative medicine solutions including synthetic torpor and/or continuous self-monitoring of eating, sleeping, moving to enable remotely supervised self-treatment.",2,2021-07-01,Review,NA
85102986779,Results from radiation environment measurements aboard ExoMars Trace Gas Orbiter in Mars science orbit in May 2018–December 2019,Semkova J.,Charged particle radiation measurements | Cosmic rays | Experimental techniques | Interplanetary medium | Mars,Icarus,361,NA,NA,10.1016/j.icarus.2020.114264,"ExoMars is a joint ESA - Rosscosmos program for investigating Mars. Two missions are foreseen within this program: one consisting of the Trace Gas Orbiter (TGO), that carries scientific instruments for the detection of trace gases in the Martian atmosphere and for the location of their source regions, launched on March 14, 2016; and the other, featuring a rover and a surface platform, with a launch date of 2022. In March 2018 TGO was inserted into circular Mars science orbit with a 400 km altitude. The dosimetric telescope Liulin-MO for measuring the radiation environment onboard the ExoMars TGO is a module of the Fine Resolution Epithermal Neutron Detector (FREND). Here we present recent results from measurements of the charged particle fluxes, dose rates and estimation of dose equivalent rates at ExoMars TGO science orbit, provided by Liulin-MO dosimeter. The obtained data from May 2018 to December 2019 show that: 1) Increase of the dose rate, dose equivalent rate and flux is observed during this period, which corresponds to the increase of galactic cosmic rays (GCR) intensity during the declining of the solar activity. Measurements in two perpendicular directions along axes X and Z of TGO show that the average fluxes for the period are 3.08 cm−2 s−1 and 3.18 cm−2 s−1, the average dose rates are 352 ± 35 μGy day−1 and 366 ± 36 μGy day−1, the average dose equivalent rates are 1.6 ± 0.33 mSv day−1 and 1.65 ± 0.34 mSv day−1; 2) There is slight dependence of the flux distribution on the Martian latitude and longitude; 3) Data from two independent instruments is also evaluated and compared to: good agreement between the GCR count rates time profiles from Liulin-MO, neutron detectors of FREND and High Energy Neutron Detector (HEND) onboard Mars Odyssey orbiter is observed. The comparison between simulations of dose rate carried out with OLTARIS tool using the GCR model of Matthiä et al., 2013 and Liulin-MO measurements during the transit to Mars and on the high elliptic orbit show that the measured dose rate behind the shielding of the detectors of Liulin-MO is about 25% higher than the simulated values. The data obtained confirm the worsening of the radiation conditions in the interplanetary space. Our evaluations show that with respect to the values measured during TGO transit to Mars (April–September 2016) in December 2019 the particle flux in the free space has increased at least by 16% and the dose rate – by 23%. The GCR dose rate in free space during the minimum of 24th solar cycle, based on Liulin-MO data is significantly higher than the dose rate measured by CRaTER instrument onboard Lunar Reconnaissance Orbiter during the minimum of 23rd cycle.",0,2021-06-01,Article,European Space Agency
85107198555,Radiation risks in a mission to mars for a solar particle event similar to the ad 993/4 event,Zaman F.A.,Astronauts | Mars | Martian surface | Solar particle event | Space travel,Aerospace,8,5,NA,10.3390/aerospace8050143,"Within the past decade, evidence of excess atmospheric14C production in tree rings, coupled with an increase in annually resolved measurements of10Be in Arctic and Antarctic ice cores, have indicated that an extremely large solar particle event (SPE) occurred in AD 993/4. The production of cosmogenic nuclei, such as36Cl in consonance with10Be, indicate that the event had a very energetic “hard” particle spectrum, comparable to the event of February 1956. Herein, we estimate the potential radiation risk to male and female crew members on a mission to Mars that would occur from such an SPE. Critical organ doses and effective doses are calculated and compared with NASA space radiation limits for an SPE comparable to the AD 993/4 event, occurring during the transit phase to Mars, or while the crew members are operating on the surface of Mars. Aluminum shielding, similar in thickness to a surface lander, a spacecraft, and a storm shelter area within the spacecraft, are assumed for the transit phase. For surface operations, including the shielding provided by the atmosphere of Mars, shielding comparable to a spacesuit, enclosed rover, and a surface habitat are assumed. The results of our simulations indicate that such an event might have severe consequences for astronauts in transit to Mars. However, on the surface of Mars, the atmosphere provides some protection against an event similar to the 993/4 SPE. In general, the results show that additional shielding may be required for some of the assumed shielding scenarios.",1,2021-05-01,Article,NA
85105407867,A bespoke health risk assessment methodology for the radiation protection of astronauts,Walsh L.,Radiation attributed decrease of survival | Radiation risk model | Radiation-related cancer | Space flight | Space radiation protection,Radiation and Environmental Biophysics,60,2,213-231,10.1007/s00411-021-00910-0,"An alternative approach that is particularly suitable for the radiation health risk assessment (HRA) of astronauts is presented. The quantity, Radiation Attributed Decrease of Survival (RADS), representing the cumulative decrease in the unknown survival curve at a certain attained age, due to the radiation exposure at an earlier age, forms the basis for this alternative approach. Results are provided for all solid cancer plus leukemia incidence RADS from estimated doses from theoretical radiation exposures accumulated during long-term missions to the Moon or Mars. For example, it is shown that a 1000-day Mars exploration mission with a hypothetical mission effective dose of 1.07 Sv at typical astronaut ages around 40 years old, will result in the probability of surviving free of all types of solid cancer and leukemia until retirement age (65 years) being reduced by 4.2% (95% CI 3.2; 5.3) for males and 5.8% (95% CI 4.8; 7.0) for females. RADS dose–responses are given, for the outcomes for incidence of all solid cancer, leukemia, lung and female breast cancer. Results showing how RADS varies with age at exposure, attained age and other factors are also presented. The advantages of this alternative approach, over currently applied methodologies for the long-term radiation protection of astronauts after mission exposures, are presented with example calculations applicable to European astronaut occupational HRA. Some tentative suggestions for new types of occupational risk limits for space missions are given while acknowledging that the setting of astronaut radiation-related risk limits will ultimately be decided by the Space Agencies. Suggestions are provided for further work which builds on and extends this new HRA approach, e.g., by eventually including non-cancer effects and detailed space dosimetry.",0,2021-05-01,Article,U.S. Department of Energy

More information is needed on how to determine the neutron dose to better estimate the true biological effects of neutrons and mixed-field (i.e., neutron and photon) radiation exposures. While exposure to gamma-ray radiation will cause significant health issues, the addition of neutrons will likely exacerbate the biological effects already anticipated after radiation exposure. To begin to understand the issues and knowledge gaps in these areas, the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases (NIAID), Radiation Nuclear Countermeasures Program (RNCP), Department of Defense (DoD), Defense Threat Reduction Agency (DTRA), and National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) formed an inter-Agency working group to host a Neutron Radiobiology and Dosimetry Workshop on March 7, 2019 in Rockville, MD. Stakeholder interests were clearly positioned, given the differences in the missions of each agency. An overview of neutron dosimetry and neutron radiobiology was included, as well as a historical overview of neutron exposure research. In addition, current research in the fields of biodosimetry and diagnostics, medical countermeasures (MCMs) and treatment, long-Term health effects, and computational studies were presented and discussed.",1,2021-05-01,Conference Paper,NA

In 2016, a series of three analog missions concluded at the Hawaii Space Exploration Analog and Simulation (HI-SEAS) facility. Three crews, each with six volunteers per mission, completed consecutive missions of increasing duration, simulating the isolation and confinement of a Mars exploration mission. The durations of the analog missions were 4 months, 8 months, and 12 months, respectively. In this paper, former crew members of these three missions compare how each crew organized their schedules with regard to work routines and social activities. We outline group-living habits that evolved similarly in the independent crews, and we discuss where social norms differed, leading to idiosyncratic policies for group-living during each mission. This information may serve as a reference to mission planners of both simulated and actual human spaceflight missions and also offers insights for psychology researchers that could motivate future studies of team cohesion and performance.",0,2021-05-01,Article,National Aeronautics and Space Administration

This crisis resulted in an almost two-month lockdown in France — lockdown that has serious impacts on physical and mental health. This unprecedented situation resulted in an important reflection about the mental health of the persons experiencing this crisis. The aim of our study was to apprehend the emotional state of the persons experiencing this lockdown, taking into account day-to-day life and feelings of loneliness. In order to develop a good comprehension of the impact of this situation on mental health, we recruited 4689 persons through an online survey between March 17th and May 11th of 2020 in France. We used several psychometric tools that gave us access to various data, such as socio-biographical information, situational variables — place of living, work context, etc. — and psychological state — depressive symptoms, anxiety, loneliness, etc. This paper focuses mostly on the UCLA loneliness scale, and the French Canadian version of the Psychiatric Symptoms Index (PSI), which measures psychological distress, as well as depressive symptoms, anxiety and cognitive impairment. Results show a moderate psychological distress for 27.5% of our sample, with depressive symptomatology, irritability or cognitive impairment. There is also a high loneliness feeling in 21.8% of the sample. Psychological distress is explained by sociodemographic variables — such as gender and age — but also by situational information — type of housing and persistence of income — and the loneliness feeling. If this pandemic and this lockdown show a clear impact on the emotional life of the French population, these results need to be taken into account with a broader range of situational and psychological variables. These additional data would help us have a more thorough understanding of the underlying factors explaining this difficult experience of the crisis. This comprehension also needs to go further in time and think about the repercussions beyond the end of the lockdown, in order to observe the evolution of these emotions and the potential persistence of psychological distress.",0,2021-05-01,Article,Agence Nationale pour le Développement de la Recherche en Santé

Isolation, confinement, hypoxia or hypercapnia in a less pressurized atmosphere, darkness and other factors are expected to endanger a mission's success, directly influencing human performance. In order to study the effects of such environmental conditions on human beings, the SIMSKILL Experiment aims to investigate how spacecraft piloting performance decays over time by deploying a Soyuz flight simulator on the Antarctic research stations Halley VI and Concordia, which feature similar living conditions as those of a space mission, leading eventually to muscular atrophy, loss of cognitive capacities, and reduction of psycho-motor skills. This paper offers an analysis on the recorded data from the scientific campaigns in Antarctica, compared to those of the subjects in a control group in Stuttgart, Germany. An overall total of 69 subjects and more than one thousand approach and docking flights to the ISS performed in a Soyuz-TMA simulator have been analysed using a performance assessment methodology. The post-processed simulation dataset allows to recognize collective trends and find which are the essential parameters that affect the pilot's skill evolution. The results obtained from this analysis show how the influence of isolation, confinement and hypoxia in Antarctica is crucial to understand how differences in performance appear between subjects. The significance of the obtained results has been proven by means of statistical models, which show that a one-month training refreshing delivers satisfactory performance for a docking simulation, whereas a frequency of 3 months follows to a loss of piloting reliability. Moreover, the effect of isolation and hypoxia aggravates the loss of flight performance.",0,2021-02-01,Article,Bundesministerium für Wirtschaft und Technologie

Close to that area, there are vernacular adobe architectures dating back to the ancient Silk Road, two thousand years old, which were built by primitive construction methods but with complex geometry. Among all city structures, bathhouses represent the unique example of an introverted architecture that has a profound commonality with greenhouse closed-systems. Bathhouse not only isolated active interior life from the outer world but also insulated the temperature and humidity from the extreme environment of the Lut Desert. It usually also had a closed clean water system, open-air water flow circulation, and water reservoir and safe power access, all features that should be present in a greenhouse design concept for Mars. The main architectural feature of the Persian bathhouse architecture is the presence of one or more domes as a roof system. These masonry domes are characterized by ease of construction and use of local materials, absolutely consistent with the in-situ resources utilization requirements for building on Mars. Indeed, this research focuses on exploring the feasibility of using the bathhouse structural system for designing a regolith dome structure - a shelter to provide micrometeoroid and radiation shielding for a greenhouse infrastructure on Mars. The analysis has been developed through an innovative computational design model that begins with embedding the geometrical information given by the Persian domes. Consequently, it optimizes each structural element to withstand the harsh Martian environment, minimizing the cross-section while considering the minimum thickness required to provide the micro-meteoroid and radiation protection. The finite element analysis considered different inner pressurization loads from 27.6 kPa (4psi), the airlock pressure in the pre-breathing phase, to 101.3 kPa (14.7 psi) that is currently used for the ISS pressure to obtain an earth-like environment. This research selects five Persian arches for analyzing their structural performance. The domes originated by each different arch structures are highly representative of this Persian architecture typology. Among all various dome construction methods, the Karbandi (stellar vault or ribbed dome) style dating back to the third century has been chosen, as it is the most common one among various bathhouses. Converting arches to the ribbed vault morphs the shape of the dome pattern. The span of 20 m is considered as one of the input parameters. The results of the analyzed Karbandi domes have been compared with the optimum hemispherical geometry highlighting their high structural performance after the optimization and a geometric pattern that might lead to a more innovative architecture on Mars.",0,2021-01-01,Conference Paper,National Aeronautics and Space Administration

High-energy spectral breaks or “knees”, seen in all large SEP events, determine the contribution of highly penetrating protons. The streaming limit, discussed earlier, places an upper bound on particle fluences early in events and the radial variation of intensities is important for near-solar and deep-space missions. The streaming limit is a strong function of radial distance from the Sun.

After analysing the problems of safety and feasibility, we tried to design a habitat that is realizable - taking into account the cargo capacity of the spacecraft of the near future and the use of materials locally available on Mars. A further requirement for our design was that the pioneers' habitat should not be a tiny, prison-like lair, but a spacious, liveable and safe living area, which is suitable for continuous habitation.

In addition to the Space Force, the plans by NASA and private industry for exploration-class long-duration missions to the moon, near-earth asteroids, and Mars makes semi-independent medical capability in space a priority. Current practice for space-based medicine is limited and relies on a ""life-raft""scenario for emergencies. Discussions by working groups on military space-based medicine include placing a Role III equivalent facility in a lunar surface station. Surgical capability is a key requirement for that facility. Materials and Methods: To prepare for the eventuality of surgery in space, it is necessary to develop low-mass, low power, mini-surgical robots, which could serve as a celestial replacement for existing terrestrial robots. The current study focused on developing semi-autonomous capability in surgical robotics, specifically related to task automation. Two categories for end-effector tissue interaction were developed: Visual feedback from the robot to detect tissue contact, and motor current waveform measurements to detect contact force. Results: Using a pixel-to-pixel deep neural network to train, we were able to achieve an accuracy of nearly 90% for contact/no-contact detection. Large torques were predicted well by a trained long short-term memory recursive network, but the technique did not predict small torques well. Conclusion: Surgical capability on long-duration missions will require human/machine teaming with semi-autonomous surgical robots. Our existing small, lightweight, low-power miniature robots perform multiple essential tasks in one design including hemostasis, fluid management, suturing for traumatic wounds, and are fully insertable for internal surgical procedures. To prepare for the inevitable eventuality of an emergency surgery in space, it is essential that automated surgical robot capabilities be developed.",0,2021-01-01,Article,NA

The Martian atmosphere, mostly comprising carbon dioxide, is becoming more relevant to radiation researchers and therefore warrants the study of this gas mixture’s buildup properties for ionizing photon flux resulting from the secondary effects of galactic cosmic rays and solar flares. Specifically, this work uses the MCNP6 code to develop energy absorption buildup factors in finite slab models for energies ranging from 40 keV to 15 MeV with Martian regolith as the backscattering medium. The Martian carbon dioxide cycle is accounted for by determining maximum and minimum mean densities as a function of orbital position. An isotropic point source model for the atmosphere is also developed using the geometric progression fitting function. Buildup is bounded to a factor of approximately 23 at 100 keV for normally incident photons at the top of the atmosphere. For conservatism, the design problem neglects coherent scattering but assumes bremsstrahlung effects and uses Klein-Nishina free-electron cross sections for Compton scattering.",0,2021-01-01,Article,University of Texas at Austin

There is a growing desire amongst space-faring nations to venture beyond the Van Allen radiation belts to a variety of intriguing locations in our inner solar system. Mars is the ultimate destination. In two decades, we hope to vicariously share in the adventure of an intrepid crew of international astronauts on the first voyage to the red planet. This will be a daunting mission with an operational profile unlike anything astronauts have flown before. A flight to Mars will be a 50-million-kilometre journey. Interplanetary distances are so great that voice and data communications between mission control on Earth and a base on Mars will feature latencies up to 20 min. Consequently, the ground support team will not have real-time control of the systems aboard the transit spacecraft nor the surface habitat. As cargo resupply from Earth will be impossible, the onboard inventory of equipment and supplies must be planned strategically in advance. Furthermore, the size, amount, and function of onboard equipment will be constrained by limited volume, mass, and power allowances. With less oversight from the ground, all vehicle systems will need to be reliable and robust. They must function autonomously. Astronauts will rely on their own abilities and onboard resources to deal with urgent situations that will inevitably arise. The deep space environment is hazardous. Zero- and reduced-gravity effects will trigger deconditioning of the cardiovascular, musculoskeletal, and other physiological systems. While living for 2.5 years in extreme isolation, Mars crews will experience psychological stressors such as loss of privacy, reduced comforts of living, and distant relationships with family members and friends. Beyond Earth’s protective magnetosphere, the fluence of ionising radiation will be higher. Longer exposure of astronauts to galactic cosmic radiation could result in the formation of cataracts, impaired wound healing, and degenerative tissue diseases. Genetic mutations and the onset of cancer later in life are also possible. Acute radiation sickness and even death could ensue from a large and unpredictable solar particle event. There are many technological barriers that prevent us from carrying out a mission to Mars today. Before launching the first crew, we will need to develop processes for in-situ resource utilisation. Rather than bringing along large quantities of oxygen, water, and propellant from Earth, future astronauts will need to produce some of these consumables from local space-based resources. Ion propulsion systems will be needed to reduce travel times to interplanetary destinations, and we will need systems to land larger payloads (up to 40 tonnes of equipment and supplies for a human mission) on planetary surfaces. These and other innovations will be needed before humans venture into deep space. However, it is the delivery of health care that is regarded as one of the most important obstacles to be overcome. Physicians, biomedical engineers, human factors specialists, and radiation experts are re-thinking operational concepts of health care, crew performance, and life support. Traditional oversight of astronaut health by ground-based medical teams will no longer be possible, particularly in urgent situations. Aborting a deep space mission to medically evacuate an ill or injured crew member to Earth will not be an option. Future crews must have all of the capability and responsibility to monitor and manage their own health. Onboard medical resources must include imaging, surgery, and emergency care, as well as laboratory analysis of blood, urine, and other biospecimens. At least one member of the crew should be a broadly trained physician with experience in remote medicine. She/he will be supported by an onboard health informatics network that is artificial intelligence enabled to assist with monitoring, diagnosis, and treatment. In other words, health care in deep space will become more autonomous, intelligent, and point of care. The International Commission on Radiological Protection (ICRP) has dedicated a day of its 5th International Symposium in Adelaide to the theme of Mars exploration. ICRP has brought global experts together today to consider the pressing issues of radiation protection. There are many issues to be addressed: Can the radiation countermeasures currently used in low Earth orbit be adapted for deep space? Can materials of low atomic weight be integrated into the structure of deep space vehicles to shield the crew? In the event of a major solar particle event, could a safe haven shelter the crew adequately from high doses of radiation? Could Martian regolith be used as shielding material for subterranean habitats? Will shielding alone be sufficient to minimise exposure, or will biological and pharmacological countermeasures also be needed? Beyond this symposium, I will value the continued involvement of ICRP in space exploration. ICRP has recently established Task Group 115 to examine radiation effects on the health of astronaut crew and to recommend exposure limits. This work will be vital. Biological effects of radiation could not only impact the health, well-being, and performance of future explorers, but also the length and quality of their lives. While humanity has dreamed of travel to the red planet for decades, an actual mission is finally starting to feel like a possibility. How exciting! I thank ICRP for its ongoing work to protect radiation workers on Earth. In the future, we will depend on counsel from ICRP to protect extraterrestrial workers and to enable the exploration of deep space.",0,2020-12-01,Article,NA

Earth-based preclinical studies show space radiation decreases rodent performance in low- and some high-level cognitive tasks. Given astronaut use of touchscreen platforms during training and space flight and given the ability of rodent touchscreen tasks to assess functional integrity of brain circuits and multiple cognitive domains in a non-aversive way, here we exposed 6-month-old C57BL/6J male mice to whole-body space radiation and subsequently assessed them on a touchscreen battery. Relative to Sham treatment, 56Fe irradiation did not overtly change performance on tasks of visual discrimination, reversal learning, rule-based, or object-spatial paired associates learning, suggesting preserved functional integrity of supporting brain circuits. Surprisingly, 56Fe irradiation improved performance on a dentate gyrus-reliant pattern separation task; irradiated mice learned faster and were more accurate than controls. Improved pattern separation performance did not appear to be touchscreen-, radiation particle-, or neurogenesis-dependent, as 56Fe and 28Si irradiation led to faster context discrimination in a non-touchscreen task and 56Fe decreased new dentate gyrus neurons relative to Sham. These data urge revisitation of the broadly-held view that space radiation is detrimental to cognition.",8,2020-12-01,Article,National Institutes of Health

One Health indicates an inherently complex, contextually interrelated system with consideration of human, animal, plant, systems engineering, and environmental health, their interrelationships, and networks. One Health implies seamless integration of subsystem co-dependencies to achieve an outcome of overall health protection for the individual. One of the most challenging aspects of space travel involves prevention, mitigation and protection from radiation injuries. While avoidance altogether is the best approach, these authors will focus on minimized exposure through limiting time in the space radiation environment in the transit to Mars and back. Implementation of the pillars of time, distance and shielding comprise ALARA, “As Low as Reasonably Achievable” (www.cdc.gov/nceh/radiation/alara.html) and is stressed in this strategy. This general overview will briefly describe the critical components of space environmental health in anticipation of increasing duration and interaction of human, animal, and plant habitation of aerospace and extreme environments into the future. Of the many considerations that could be addressed, precision medicine, and bioinformatics are the most rapidly evolving.

Besides cancer, cardiovascular disease and acute radiation syndrome, there are concerns over the potential behavioral and cognitive impairments caused by exposure of the astronauts' central nervous system to high levels of space radiation. Therefore, potential behavioral and cognitive impairments caused by astronauts' brains exposure to high levels of space radiation and the possibility of developing dementia and other motor neuron diseases are getting more attention. As NASA is interested in studies on radium deposition in human brain, and exposure of the brain to high linear energy transfer (LET) alpha particles, we have assessed the cognitive effects of long-term exposure of human brain to alpha particles which partly mimics astronauts' exposure to high charge and energy (HZE) particles during upcoming mars missions. Dr. John Boice, President of NCRP, and his colleagues' have stated that human brain exposed for years to alpha particles on Earth may be more relevant to a Mars mission in contrast with the mouse brain exposed to heavy ions for a few minutes. Interestingly, both Boice and NASA did not pay enough attention to this fact that radium as well as many other alpha emitters tend to accumulate in the bone, and the alpha particles whose energies are typically 5 MeV have a very short range (maximum 10s of \mu \mathrm{m}), so the radiation dose due to the alpha emitters would be localized to volumes near the cranium rather than being uniformly distributed throughout the cerebral and cerebellar parenchyma. Extraordinary high levels of 226Ra have previously been reported in high background radiation areas of Ramsar, where people are consuming locally grown foods. In this paper, we will present data which provide a human brain radiation exposure analogue for upcoming Mars missions. Normally the dose to the functional parts of the brain are not likely to be significant, even with higher uptakes of the radium or other alpha-emitting isotopes in the cranium. Therefore, only residents with calcium-rich diet were selected for the study. Measurements of background gamma radiation was performed in their bedrooms, dining rooms, vegetable yards and gardens with citrus fruit trees of the dwellings in areas with high levels of 226Ra in the soil and at a nearby control area with the same socio-economic factors. Moreover, the food frequency, reaction time, working memory and computational abilities as well as the Radium Ingestion Index (RII) of 47 participants (22 males and 24 females) from the hot areas, where the annual radiation absorbed dose from background radiation is up to 260 mSv/y, were studied, and the same things were studied for 17 participants (4 males and 13 females) from a nearby normal background radiation area with the same socioeconomic factors as at the hot areas. Our study showed that exposure of human brain to high LET particles did not affect the working memory. However, individuals with higher levels of radium ingestion had significantly increased reaction times. The increased reaction time in individuals with higher exposure levels to alpha particles emitted from ingested 226Ra is an important finding, since similar conditions might occur in deep space, when astronauts' brain cells are exposed to HZE particles. As the astronauts face numerous challenges in isolated and confined space environment, they should be able to respond quickly to different hazards. However, further studies are needed to verify if the findings in high radiation dose areas in Ramsar are relevant for deep space mission.",1,2020-03-01,Conference Paper,Shiraz University of Medical Sciences

Currently, materials used to protect against this radiation are composed of larger atoms that produce secondary radiation when irradiated. A lower effective atomic number, adequate specific strength and thermal conductivity characteristics are parameters considered for a better alternative. The inspiration for this project was the tardigrade. A micro-animal that is able to survive harsh environments including space radiation because of the unique Dsup protein it produces that protects its DNA on a molecular level. Boron nitride nanotubes (BNNTs) have a high specific strength, varying thermal conductivity and, when hydrogenated, are superior in radiation protection, while emitting minimal secondary radiation. In this work, different low outgassing matrices were evaluated for the formulation of nanocomposites with BNNT and 5% hydrogen by mass (BNNT+H2). The matrices considered were: tetraglycidyl-4,4'-methylene dianiline (epoxy), poly(ether ether ketone) or PEEK and fayalite (Fe2SiO4, an iron rich mineral found on many terrestrial planets). The radiation protection, thermal conductivity, specific strength and density of composites developed from BNNT and these matrices were analyzed. We found that 90% BNNT+H2 by mass in an epoxy matrix surpasses water in radiation protection and has a thermal conductivity approximately nine times greater than that of water. Monte Carlo simulations implementing the novel RadProc Index were used to evaluate conventional materials and BNNT+H2 in epoxy for 10%, 50% and 90% BNNT+H2 by mass. This composite has similar radiation protection capabilities to water for the same mass with 50%-90% BNNT+H2, in addition to performing better than polyethylene. Therefore, BNNT nanocomposites could be innovative and competitive materials for use in passive radiation protection in space suits, spacecraft and habitats.",0,2020-01-01,Conference Paper,NA

A strategic view of the fidelity of hazards experienced on different platforms can shape the testing plans for human research and technology demonstration related to crew health and performance. Working across the international partnership, the International Space Station (ISS) is planning periods of modified operations to improve the fidelity of Mars simulations. To understand transit durations as an independent variable, a series of 1-year, 6-month and 30-45 day missions are being planned on ISS. Standard measurements across ISS missions of different durations, lunar missions and ground analogs offers the opportunity to distinguish different hazards and their effects in the context of the relevance to future mission concepts. The ISS partnership is planning for additional test cases that are aligned with Mars mission plans. (1) Evaluating crew performance capabilities when transitioning to gravity after long durations in microgravity representative of a Mars transit. (2) Simulating crew medical care under Mars-like autonomous operations. (3) Identification and testing of operations under communications delay and autonomy expected for Mars missions and the linked effects on behavioral health and performance of the crew. Artemis missions serve as a valuable analogs for Mars surface operations, with partial gravity and deep space radiation hazards, but with crewmembers that are probably more physically capable than their counterparts would be after a Mars transit. Getting unobtrusive data from early Artemis missions, and knowledge gained from operational experience as Artemis operations develop can improve engineering design, medical requirements and countermeasures, and ultimately ensure mission success on Mars. Linking Mars architectures with the plans and capabilities for ISS and Artemis allows us to plan to most operationally relevant tests of crew health and performance on current spaceflight missions to inform planning for future missions to Mars.

Prophylactic surgery before spaceflight may eliminate the risk of appendicitis and cholecystitis in astronauts on deep space missions. However, even minimally invasive surgery increases the risk of small bowel obstruction (SBO). Probabilistic risk assessment (PRA) is a method that can be used to estimate the benefits and risks of prophylactic surgery. Methods. Risks of appendicitis and cholecystitis during a 2.5-year Mars mission are compared to the risk of SBO after laparoscopic removal of the appendix, gallbladder, or both. A PRA model using Monte Carlo methodology was used to forecast the risks. Results. Prophylactic appendectomy and cholecystectomy combined, conferred an increased probability of medical evacuation (pEVAC) due to SBO as compared to the no surgery group. A slightly higher probability for the loss of crew life (pLOCL) was found in the no surgery group when compared to the cases in which either prophylactic appendectomy alone, or appendectomy plus cholecystectomy are performed. Discussion. The need for medical evacuation can be viewed as a potential risk for death in the context of a space mission where evacuation is not possible. Because of the higher pEVAC due to SBO and relatively small benefit in the reduction of pLOCL in the prophylactic surgery groups, this analysis does not support the prophylactic removal of appendix and/or gallbladder for spaceflight. Future advances in surgical or medical technique or mission medical capabilities may change these results.

Previous research conducted during spaceflight and in analog settings has produced discrepant, sometimes contradictory findings and relied on measures that have not been validated for use in extreme environments, where the number, intensity, and duration of stressors exceed typical human experience. We therefore developed the Mental Health Checklist (MHCL) based on subject matter interviews and comprehensive literature reviews. In study one, exploratory and confirmatory factor analyses resulted in 3 reliable subscales (positive adaptation, poor self-regulation, and anxious apprehension) explaining 53% of the total variance. In study two, we examined the reliability and convergent validity of the MHCL in large sample of participants stationed in Antarctica. Findings suggest the MHCL to have acceptable psychometric properties for use in extreme settings. We encourage other researchers to incorporate the MHCL in future studies, including spaceflight research, and to examine its sensitivity for capturing intra-individual symptom changes over time.",3,2019-08-01,Article,National Institutes of Health

Using a new, low dose-rate neutron irradiation facility, we have uncovered that realistic, low dose-rate exposures produce serious neurocognitive complications associated with impaired neurotransmission. Chronic (6 month) low-dose (18 cGy) and dose rate (1 mGy/d) exposures of mice to a mixed field of neutrons and photons result in diminished hippocampal neuronal excitability and disrupted hippocampal and cortical long-term potentiation. Furthermore, mice displayed severe impairments in learning and memory, and the emergence of distress behaviors.

In cases in which a human doctor or medical coordinator is not present, patient care, particularly from non-experts, becomes more difficult. The difficulty increases when care is completed at a remote site, for example, on a manned mission to Mars. Communication capability from medical experts on Mars is limited. To address this problem, a medical assistant remote system is proposed to act as a coordinator between the humans present and the remote medical experts. A virtual agent assuming such a role will accept feedback from both, running the situation without errors and additional stress. Leadership styles will be employed by the agent to develop trust and perception of competence among its followers. Additionally, prediction of behaviour and situational changes by both medical professionals and by the agent are necessary in order to combat a 10-minute latency affecting communication between Earth and Mars.",0,2019-07-01,Conference Paper,NA

The radiation environment inside a human space habitat, generated by the interaction of the Galactic Cosmic Rays and occasionally of Solar Particle Events with the spacecraft hull, is peculiar due to its composition (ions from Hydrogen to Iron, knock out neutrons) and the large kinetic energy range of the particles. For this reason the risk assessment approach used for astronauts in space is quite different from the one used on Earth. In this approach the risk for astronauts is evaluated calculating factors which score the risk in function of physical characteristics of the single particle, like the quality factor Q (related to the radiation ionizing power) or the squared ratio between the charge (Z) and velocity (β) of the particle (Z 2/β 2). LIDAL-ALTEA (Light Ion Detector for ALTEA - Anomalous Long Term Effects on Astronauts) is an experimental apparatus which will allow to evaluate for the first time in the field the Z 2/β 2 risk factor of the single detected particle on-board the International Space Station. The LIDAL system is a Time-Of-Flight detector designed to work paired to three Silicon Detector Units of the ALTEA, which will measure the deposited energy of the passing particle. The velocity of the particle (β), calculated from the Time-Of-Flight measurement performed by LIDAL, allows to evaluate the particle electric charge once related to the deposited energy measured by ALTEA. A first LIDAL prototype has been developed by the University of Rome ""Tor Vergata"" and tested at TIFPA (Trento Insistute for Fundamental Physics Applications) proton beam line, in order to evaluate the timing performances of the detector. Results are briefly presented and the current status of the apparatus production is discussed in view of the launch scheduled for 2019.",1,2019-06-10,Conference Paper,NA

For the past five years, with the establishment of the Radiation Assessment Detector (RAD) onboard the Mars Science Laboratory (MSL) rover Curiosity at Mars, it is possible to continuously detect, for the first time, FDs at another planet: Mars. In this work, we have compiled a catalog of 424 FDs at Mars using RAD dose rate data, from 2012 to 2016. Furthermore, we applied, for the first time, a comparative statistical analysis of the FDs measured at Mars, by RAD, and at Earth, by NMs, for the same time span. A carefully chosen sample of FDs at Earth and at Mars, driven by the same ICME, led to a significant correlation (cc= 0.71) and a linear regression between the sizes of the FDs at the different observing points at the respective energies at Mars and Earth. We show that the amplitude of the FD at Mars (AM), for an energy of E>150MeV, is higher by a factor of 1.5 – 2 compared to the size of the FD at Earth (AE), for a definite rigidity of 10 GV.

Accurate knowledge of the physical characteristics of the radiation field, the solar activity and the mission length, which influence the radiation risks for humans on deep space missions, e.g. to Mars, is therefore very important. It has been estimated that the transit times for a human mission to Mars vary from 5 to 7 months each way, with a typical figure of about 6 months for a long duration stay on Mars, up to 8 - 10 months each way for a short duration stay on Mars. That means that the astronauts will be exposed to a harsh radiation environment for at least 2-3 years. This paper describes the radiation environment in deep space, some of the radiation health risks astronauts are exposed to on long term missions, as well as the requirements and limitations of physical protection for reducing these risks. Since it has been shown that physical shielding alone is not adequate for long term deep space missions [1], [2], we also present the need for new effective methods of biological protection, e.g. ground-based in vitro preflight screening of the candidates for evaluation of the magnitude of their adaptive responses. Furthermore, methods for boosting the immune system of astronauts and the possibility of using medical counter-measures are discussed.

85079197606,Optimization of deep space habitats for the space radiation environment,Lund M.,NA,"Proceedings of the International Astronautical Congress, IAC",2019-October,NA,NA,NA,"Deep space habitats on Mars or the Moon are exposed to the space radiation environment, due to their lack of a magnetic field to deflect Galactic Cosmic Rays (GCR), Solar Particle Events (SPE), and trapped radiation belts. GCR are composed of high energy protons through heavy-Z ions (HZE) up to 1000 TeV, which are very difficult to block against due to their high energy in a habitat. Traditional habitat designs would not protect astronauts on the surface from radiation, because current passive shielding technology uses only the structure's materials to attenuate incoming radiation. This would require several meters thick of material to shield a habitat, which would be mass and cost-prohibitive. Thus, future missions require another method to protect habitats from GCR, such as suggested by using Martian/lunar soil as a shielding material. This study analysed varying thickness of Martian/lunar soil to optimize a deep space habitat for extended Martian or lunar mission, using SERA (Space Environment Radiation Analysis). SERA, built on CERN's GEANT4 C++ toolkit for Monte Carlo modelling, is combined with SANDIA national lab's DAKOTA, an optimization software package, to quickly prototype and analyse different shielding configurations. SERA can analyse radiation transport in many different environments from planetary to deep space, because of the flexibility of geometry and source definition. SERA propagates radiation through passive shielding materials to simulate dose and equivalent dose to an International Commission of Radiation Units (ICRU) spheres or human phantom within a spacecraft or habitat. SERA is optimized for high-performance computing (HPC) clusters, using multithreading and Message Passing Interface (MPI). This architecture allows for multiple simulations to run concurrently controlled by DAKOTA for an iterative system to complete optimization and parametric studies of passive shielding design space. DAKOTA iteratively analysis different passive shielding configurations by altering materials, thicknesses, and configurations, using either parametric analysis or genetic algorithms to design a passive shield for a deep space habitat. Presented here is an analysis of varying soil thickness to reduce the dose to a below ground Martian or lunar habitat, using SERA with DAKOTA to optimize shielding.",0,2019-01-01,Conference Paper,National Aeronautics and Space Administration

After successful reception of early telemetry and achieving commandability, both spacecraft transitioned to nominal mode to begin checkout operations. Subsequent passes demonstrated 62.5 - 8000 bps one-way and two-way communications, ranging, Delta-DOR tracking, and multiple spacecraft per aperture operations with the DSN. All four antennas (UHF, low gain, medium gain, and high gain) performed well and were characterized in flight. The spacecraft successfully performed multiple trajectory correction maneuvers to achieve its flyby of Mars, and autonomously oriented itself for imaging, solar-radiation-pressure reduction, and charging. Early in the mission, the project partnered with both Morehead State University and SRI to perform in-flight tests of the UHF bent-pipe-relay designed for InSight. Goundstations broadcast a recorded InSight data stream to the MarCO spacecraft over UHF, each spacecraft received the data and packaged it for transmission, and then the vehicles downlinked the transmissions to the Goldstone and Canberra DSN stations. The successful in-flight data-flow test exercised much of the bent-pipe sequence required to support InSight at Mars. The spacecraft also utilized on-board imaging to verify deployment of the HGA reflectarray. By choosing an advantageous angle, MarCO-B was able to simultaneously image the Earth and Moon at a distance of approximately 1 million kilometers. This unique vantage point exemplifies some of the use-cases of low-cost explorers, including providing observational capability that a larger explorer might not be able to provide on its own. On November 26, 2018, the MarCO spacecraft successfully flew by Mars while relaying entry-descent-and-landing telemetry for the InSight vehicle. Both spacecraft performed beyond expectations and were able to provide a real-time link for the so-called”seven minutes of terror”. In addition, once InSight safely landed, it transmitted its first image of the Martian surface through MarCO. Over the following weeks, images of Mars and Phobos, performance and health information of the spacecraft, and historical data were all downlinked.

85079158278,Hybrid habitat for Mars: Creating comfort with light,van Ellen L.A.,Architecture | Daylight | Mars | Space,"Proceedings of the International Astronautical Congress, IAC",2019-October,NA,NA,NA,"In terms of space architecture, the biggest technological challenges towards manned missions on Mars, are radiation protection as well as the use of ISRU. The design for a space habitat therefore calls for a technology driven design, often using material sciences as starting point. However, the use of this methodology can overlook architectural aspects that are important for the well-being of the crew, which is, in turn, critical for the completion of the mission. This project focusses on the beneficial aspect of introducing daylight in a working/living environment. Therefore, a preliminary research tested the translucency of different materials in extreme cold [-40°C] to simulate the Martian environment. The use of two distinct materials were found to comply well to all the qualitative as well as the quantitative requirements. These two materials form the structural element for the hybrid habitat as well as form a radiation protection for the crew. The first material is found abundantly on Mars and is the main structural element: ice. As first barrier with the Martian environment, the translucent material will let daylight in the habitat, meaning that day and night changes can be felt by the crew which will reduce their overall anxiety and homesickness. Ice also has peculiar properties that can reinforce the structural elements of the habitat depending on the outdoor climate. It also has repairing properties that no other material possess which is critical for a redundant design. The second material will ensure most of the thermal insulation as well as the secondary structure of the habitat. This material is not found on Mars but can be sourced from the atmosphere using ISRU: polycarbonate (PC). This secondary structure consist of the finished interior walls and windows, as PC resists well under low temperatures and is relatively easy to make as no high pressure is required. Both the ice and PC are excellent against radiation, especially PC which traps secondary radiation. As the indoor partition walls are made from PC, this will increase the radiation protection within the core of the habitat. By cleverly designing the functions and layout, less materials are needed to build this hybrid habitat. Most importantly, as these PC walls are also translucent, shadows will be seen from one room to another. This will improve the overall comfort of the crew as they interact both with themselves and with the outdoor environment via the radiation shielding windows.",0,2019-01-01,Conference Paper,European Commission

Crew Medical Officer (CMO) proficiency in select surgical procedures is critical for astronaut safety in spaceflight beyond low-Earth orbit; crews on Mars will experience communication delays exceeding 20 minutes, prohibiting interaction with terrestrial resources during surgical emergencies. A concise, targeted surgical training protocol is necessary to ensure crew preparedness. METHODS An in-depth PubMed literature review encompassed over sixty papers (1996-2018) pertaining to surgery in remote and resource-limited environments, identifying the procedures most critical for ensuring crew health and safety. The protocol designed incorporates principles of laparoscopic and endoscopic training published by SAGES and ultrasound guidance outlined by the AIUM. RESULTS NASA's Integrated Medical Model outlines the 100 conditions most likely to develop inflight, 26 of which may require surgical intervention; the likelihood of a surgical event among a 4-member crew during a 3-year Mars mission nears 18%. Our team generated a protocol for procedural training, incorporating lecture, demonstration, and practice with synthetic and fresh tissue models, at both 1-g and in reduced gravity. We have integrated virtual and augmented reality-based segments to refresh these skills during a mission, as well as modules that provide real-time guidance for on-demand use in the emergent setting. CONCLUSIONS A surgical protocol for deep space missions should provide an efficient and versatile platform for training of the CMO.

This paper presents a Martian greenhouse design based on human factors and aesthetics integration in the overall greenhouse architecture. Regarding the concept of operation, the greenhouse does not operate independently but has an independent closed-loop system. Therefore, adding water consumption for sanitary, laundry, and kitchen functions would not affect the overall amount of water storage. Besides, relocating a gym from the habitat to the greenhouse is beneficial for the air quality of the habitat, and excessive production of carbon dioxide is beneficial for plant growth. An indoor garden with public space for social interactions and personal space for a private time would support crew morale and improve their quality of life. In summary, this paper presents the criteria for trade studies concerning the maximum cultivation area of a greenhouse with more human-centered spaces. Interior design examples are compared and qualitatively evaluated based on their effectiveness from the viewpoint of volume and area utilization, systems requirements, human activities, and psychological support and aesthetics.",2,2019-01-01,Conference Paper,NA

The observations were carried out during two stratospheric balloon flights in the northern Sweden in winter of 2011. Two-fold objectives were attained as the outcome of these flights and the data analysis. First aimed at understanding the mechanisms that control the electric properties of the auroral atmosphere and at estimation of some key parameters from the measured data, such as the charge and current density, the mobility of the small-ions, their concentration and generation rate, as well as the radiation dose rate. Second objective was to test the SDA instrument performances in a radiation environment close to that we expect to encounter near the Mars surface.",1,2019-01-01,Article,Centre National d’Etudes Spatiales

This elevated radiation dose is mainly due to Galactic Cosmic Rays and Solar Particle Events. Specific patterns of the N-glycosylation of human Igs have already been associated with various ailments such as autoimmune diseases, malignant transformation, chronic inflammation, and ageing. The focus of our work was to investigate the effect of low-energy proton irradiation on the IgG N-glycosylation profile with the goal if disease associated changes could be detected during space travel and not altered by space radiation. Two ionization sources were used during the experiments, a Van de Graaff generator for the irradiation of solidified hIgG samples in vacuum, and a Tandetron accelerator to irradiate hIgG samples in aqueous solution form. Structural carbohydrate analysis was accomplished by CE with laser induced fluorescent detection to determine the effects of simulated space radiation on N-glycosylation of hIgG1 samples. Our results revealed that even several thousand times higher radiation doses that of astronauts can suffer during long duration missions beyond the shielding environment of Low Earth Orbit, no changes were observed in hIgG1 N-glycosylation. Consequently, changes in N-linked carbohydrate profile of IgG1 can be used as molecular diagnostic tools in space.",2,2018-11-01,Article,Hungarian Scientific Research Fund

Potential psychological and biological challenges of this mismatch have been gleaned from simulations in space-analog facilities, polar expeditions, and missions served on the International Space Station. Optimal performance and welfare of crew members will depend on successful adaptation to these challenges, which in turn depends on the satisfaction of fundamental human needs. These fundamental human needs – drawn from Maslow's hierarchy of needs – include physiological, security, relationship, and existential needs. The satisfaction of each need over the course of a protracted space mission will require the crew to overcome novel psychobiological obstacles for which they must be prepared. Of particular concern will be the rigors of an isolated environment out of sight from the travelers’ terrestrial home, leading to stress-induced depression of the immune system and potential psychological pathologies. A rationally designed mission environment that utilizes technology and measures such as biophilia to optimize the fulfillment of each human need could bolster the psychobiological resilience necessary for a successful odyssey.",7,2018-11-01,Article,NA

Here, we evaluated the impact of confinement and isolation on body composition, glucose metabolism/insulin resistance and adipokine levels. Methods: The “Mars-500 project” consisted of 520 consecutive days of confinement from June 3, 2010 to Nov 4, 2011. The crew was composed of six male subjects (three Russians, two Europeans, and one Chinese) with a median age of 31 years (range 27–38 years). Results: During the 520-day confinement, total body mass and BMI progressively decreased, reaching a significant difference at the end (417 days) of the observation period (− 9.2 and − 5.5%, respectively). Fat mass remained unchanged. A progressive and significant increase of fasting plasma glucose was observed between 249 and 417 days (+ 10/+ 17% vs baseline), with a further increase at the end of confinement (up to + 30%). Median plasma insulin showed a non-significant early increment (60 days; + 86%). Total adiponectin halved (− 47%) 60 days after hatch closure, remaining at this nadir (− 51%) level for a further 60 days. High molecular weight adiponectin remained significantly lower from 60 to 168 days. Conclusions: Based on these data, countermeasures may be envisioned to balance the potentially harmful effects of prolonged confinement, including a better exercise program, with accurate monitoring of (1) the individual activity and (2) the relationship between body composition and metabolic derangement.",9,2018-11-01,Article,Agenzia Spaziale Italiana

Recent Findings: Significant associations between radiation dose and effects of principal concern from space radiation (cancer, cardiovascular, CNS) have not yet been detected in astronauts. Therefore, estimates of radiation-induced health consequences from extended deep space missions are based on studies available from radiation-exposed human populations on Earth (e.g., A-bomb survivors) supplemented with data from biological experiments (primarily rodents) using space-type radiations obtained at specialized radiation facilities. This approach (the best available at this time) has large uncertainties, which strongly influence the number of days permitted in deep space. Summary: Based on current NASA risk limits, the length of time permitted in space may not be sufficient for a human mission to Mars, even with substantial shielding of the spacecraft. Risk mitigation strategies beyond shielding may therefore be required. Research is continuing to advance in these and related fields.",2,2018-09-01,Review,NA

Despite these realizations, whether and how realistic doses of cosmic radiation cause cognitive deficits and neuronal circuitry alterations several months after exposure remains unclear. In addition, even less is known about the temporal progression of cosmic radiation-induced changes transpiring over the duration of a time period commensurate with a flight to Mars. Here we show that rodents exposed to the second most prevalent radiation type in space (i.e. helium ions) at low, realistic doses, exhibit significant hippocampal and cortical based cognitive decrements lasting 1 year after exposure. Cosmic-radiation-induced impairments in spatial, episodic and recognition memory were temporally coincident with deficits in cognitive flexibility and reduced rates of fear extinction, elevated anxiety and depression like behavior. At the circuit level, irradiation caused significant changes in the intrinsic properties (resting membrane potential, input resistance) of principal cells in the perirhinal cortex, a region of the brain implicated by our cognitive studies. Irradiation also resulted in persistent decreases in the frequency and amplitude of the spontaneous excitatory postsynaptic currents in principal cells of the perirhinal cortex, as well as a reduction in the functional connectivity between the CA1 of the hippocampus and the perirhinal cortex. Finally, increased numbers of activated microglia revealed significant elevations in neuroinflammation in the perirhinal cortex, in agreement with the persistent nature of the perturbations in key neuronal networks after cosmic radiation exposure. These data provide new insights into cosmic radiation exposure, and reveal that even sparsely ionizing particles can disrupt the neural circuitry of the brain to compromise cognitive function over surprisingly protracted post-irradiation intervals.",46,2018-07-01,Article,National Aeronautics and Space Administration

As the solar particle event flux was gradually declining, a shock front reached Mars and caused a sudden drop of about 15% in instantaneous dose rates. No solar particles followed the shock arrival, and the magnetic shielding of galactic cosmic rays by the shock reduced their intensity to levels below those seen before the start of the event.

Alternatives are reviewed in the areas of current Mars mission architectures, contemporary shielding technologies, and medical treatment options to mitigate the risks of radiation doses received. The over-arching goal of this study is to determine whether any alternatives will reduce astronaut radiation exposure on a mission to Mars to meet the NASA space worker limits, while concurrently minimizing launch weight, costs, and other risks. Alternatives are compared via a combination of existing trade studies and swing matrices. Using these tools, it is determined that Boronated Nitride Nanotubes (BNNTs) are the highest potential composite for vehicle shielding, and it is recommended that Martian regolith should be used in parallel for any long stay by crews on the Martian surface. Two medical countermeasures, already FDA-approved, (Amifostine and Neupogen) have the highest potential for use. Further, no single shielding alternative will reduce crew exposure below existing limits, but further research may determine that a combination of composite shielding and regolith barriers could improve this outlook. Notably, the systems engineering techniques utilized herein to analyze a human mission to Mars are easily extensible to other deep space mission, such as a lunar outpost.

Two missions are foreseen within this program: one consisting of the Trace Gas Orbiter (TGO), that carries scientific instruments for the detection of trace gases in the Martian atmosphere and for the location of their source regions, plus an Entry, Descent and landing demonstrator Module (EDM), launched on March 14, 2016; and the other, featuring a rover and a surface platform, with a launch date of 2020. On October 19, 2016 TGO was inserted into high elliptic Mars’ orbit. The dosimetric telescope Liulin-MO for measuring the radiation environment onboard the ExoMars 2016 TGO is a module of the Fine Resolution Epithermal Neutron Detector (FREND). Here we present first results from measurements of the charged particle fluxes, dose rates, Linear Energy Transfer (LET) spectra and estimation of dose equivalent rates in the interplanetary space during the cruise of TGO to Mars and first results from dosimetric measurements in high elliptic Mars’ orbit. A comparison is made with the dose rates obtained by RAD instrument onboard Mars Science Laboratory during the cruise to Mars in 2011–2012 and with the Galactic Cosmic Rays (GCR) count rates provided by other particle detectors currently in space. The average measured dose rate in Si from GCR during the transit to Mars for the period April 22–September 15, 2016 is 372 ± 37 µGy d−1 and 390 ± 39 µGy d−1 in two perpendicular directions. The dose equivalent rate from GCR for the same time period is about 2 ± 0.3 mSv d−1. This is in good agreement with RAD results for radiation dose rate in Si from GCR in the interplanetary space, taking into account the different solar activity during the measurements of both instruments. About 10% increase of the dose rate, and 15% increase of the dose equivalent rate for 10.5 months flight is observed. It is due to the increase of Liulin-MO particle fluxes for that period and corresponds to the overall GCR intensity increase during the declining phase of the solar activity. Data show that during the cruise to Mars and back (6 months in each direction), taken during the declining of solar activity, the crewmembers of future manned flights to Mars will accumulate at least 60% of the total dose limit for the cosmonaut's/astronaut's career in case their shielding conditions are close to the average shielding of Liulin-MO detectors—about 10 g cm−2.

Similar to neutron monitors at Earth, RAD sees many Forbush decreases (FDs) in the galactic cosmic ray (GCR) induced surface fluxes and dose rates. These FDs are associated with coronal mass ejections (CMEs) and/or stream/corotating interaction regions (SIRs/CIRs). Orbiting above the Martian atmosphere, the Mars Atmosphere and Volatile EvolutioN (MAVEN) spacecraft has also been monitoring space weather conditions at Mars since September 2014. The penetrating particle flux channels in the solar energetic particle (SEP) instrument onboard MAVEN can also be employed to detect FDs. For the first time, we study the statistics and properties of a list of FDs observed in-situ at Mars, seen both on the surface by MSL/RAD and in orbit detected by the MAVEN/SEP instrument. Such a list of FDs can be used for studying interplanetary coronal mass ejections (ICME) propagation and SIR evolution through the inner heliosphere. The magnitudes of different FDs can be well-fitted by a power-law distribution. The systematic difference between the magnitudes of the FDs within and outside the Martian atmosphere may be mostly attributed to the energy-dependent modulation of the GCR particles by both the pass-by ICMEs/SIRs and the Martian atmosphere.",16,2018-03-01,Article,National Aeronautics and Space Administration

Over this energy range, the mean free path of a gamma ray varies from about 1 to 25 cm, therefore gamma-ray measurements sample subsurface composition. Many elements emit gamma rays at multiple, often widely spaced energies, so gamma-ray measurements can in principle also be used to identify depth-dependent variations in subsurface composition. We report results from laboratory measurements and radiation transport modeling designed to demonstrate this capability. The laboratory measurements verified the presence of depth-dependent gamma-ray signatures, and were then used to benchmark radiation transport simulations that were used to model realistic Mars-like scenarios. The models indicate that compositionally distinct subsurface deposits, buried to depths of ∼80 cm (125 g/cm2), can be identified using gamma-ray measurements. Going beyond identification to characterization (burial depth, relative composition of the layers) of the deposits requires knowledge of the vertical and horizontal variability in the water content of the near-surface surface materials, the local Galactic Cosmic Ray environment (magnitude and energy distribution), the depth-dependent neutron flux, gamma-ray production cross sections, and knowledge of the composition and column density of the atmosphere.

In deep space, communication delays and the absence of specific medical equipment or skills will pose a threat on the physical and mental well-being of astronauts. With near future plans for manned missions to the Moon and Mars, medical autonomy is of importance now. Utilization of working technologies and concepts on Earth can be readily adapted. The terrestrial healthcare innovation space has much to contribute to this field and in this review a scope of the possibilities will be presented. Emerging technologies like Virtual and Augmented Reality (VR and AR), Artificial Intelligence (AI) and others are the result of components becoming smaller, cheaper and smarter, and have led to a range of healthcare applications. Fundamentally different from previous developments, many of these technologies are digital and underpinned by software that can be scaled exponentially. VR and AR are increasingly deployed for medical training and can also be used for guidance through complex medical procedures. When seen through glasses or a head-mounted display, the inside of a spacecraft can be blended with artificial layers adding relevant data like vitals or guidance while using complex medical equipment. In terrestrial healthcare, new surgery solutions use 3D technologies to overlay imaging data on real-life subjects. Astronauts can only be trained so much for potential medical events. Artificial Intelligences in medical decision support systems, help human doctors on Earth making decisions, but will be critical to deep space astronauts that require immediate assistance. AI can also play a role in psychological counseling as psychological stresses might arise from isolation from the rest of humanity, working in extreme environments, and being confined to small spaces. Conversational AIs are actually tested worldwide to apply'traditional' Cognitive Behavioral Therapy methods in psychological coaching for patients. Skipping a 20 minutes communication delay from Earth to Mars, AI will be able to offer on-demand counseling with a skilled, but artificial psychologist. Still, the absence of gravity and presence of radiation are challenges to be dealt with, but the space sector has lots to gain from the developments in modern healthcare here on earth, especially in 'digital health'. Digital solutions ensure on-demand availability of care, focused on empowered patients.

Play as a research-through performance strategy helps us better explore, and adapt, to the new environment (serving the individual), it is a useful mode for supporting positive crew performance, cohesion and wellbeing (serving the mission), and a technical method for inspiring passive players (on site, or on Earth) to imagine a new world (serving the crew, mission and public). By streaming or post-processing 360Â° video data off-site audiences can experience the imaginative and technical parameters of planetary surface analogue simulation missions for example. From everyday yet nonetheless spellbinding phenomena such as blowing bubbles on Mars, the virtual reality capture interactions with MDRS analogue crew allows for the predictive analysis of physical and psycho-social and cultural behaviours of future crew on Mars in a range of scenarios. These cultural EVA interaction designs, and research-through-performance outcomes build on prior work to further demonstrate the benefits of creative and expressive playful processes in space-related environments including analogue simulations, in preparation for discovery in spaceflight.

In the past years, a renewed focus has been put on ISRU concepts, specifically in the context of Additive Layer Manufacturing or 3D printing to be able to create necessary radiation shielding for habitats and shelters. Different approaches to use the regolith of the Mars or the moon for building radiation shielded pressurized habitats, unpressurized shelters or for modelling the terrain have been investigated. Project RegoLight progresses solar sintering from a Technology Readiness Level (TRL) 3 to 5 as an alternative Additive Manufacturing (AM) to microwave sintering, contour crafting and others. Solar sintering has the advantage that no binders are needed, building elements such as interlocking bricks can be sintered with only using the sun and the sand thus reducing the material which needs to be brought from earth. The project RegoLight has been funded through the European Commission and comprises five partners: DLR in Cologne (coordinator), Space Applications Services (Belgium), COMEX (France), LIQUIFER Systems Group (Austria) and Bollinger + Grohmann Ingenieure (Austria). The project started in November 2016 and ended in June 2018. This paper provides the conclusions of project RegoLight with regard to the projects' main objectives: â€¢ AM approach for automated fabrication of building elements under ambient conditions, â€¢ Automated fabrication of larger structures through a mobile printing head in ambient conditions â€¢ Demonstration of producing a `building element' block from lunar regolith simulant by applying the solar sintering AM approach using a solar furnace automated setup under vacuum conditions. â€¢ Production of a `building element' with a fine structure (resolution 1.4 cm) from lunar regolith simulant under ambient conditions â€¢ Design and validation of interlocking building elements, providing a modular system for a variety of space architecture and mission requirements, â€¢ Characterization of the building elements produced (materials metrology) â€¢ Study of the application of solar sintering element manufacturing in the larger frame of a lunar base architecture (e.g. Moon Village) Latest RegoLight developments also include the description of the next steps to further the technology and mature the outcomes.

85065334423,Autonomous operations for spaceflight mission control: Challenges and benefits,Baghchehsara A.,Analog Mission | Autonomous | Autonomous | Cognitive System | Mission Control | Spaceflight Operation,"Proceedings of the International Astronautical Congress, IAC",2018-October,NA,NA,NA,"This paper studies available technologies within various levels of autonomy, circumstances of their usage, and benefits and challenges to their implementation in spaceflight mission control. Spaceflight missions are currently highly dependent on ground control centers to make decisions and carry out standard operations. Nearly real-time continuous communication coverage is maintained in Low Earth Orbit (LEO) via various control centers. However, for spaceflight beyond LEO, the critical challenge is time-delay in communications. This can be mitigated to an extent via a robust space-based communication network, but some latency between a mission and its Mission Control Center (MCC) is unavoidable. Thus, there is the desire for an autonomous system to support overall mission operations and address these challenges to communications, similar to CIMON (Crew Interactive MObile CompanioN). Implementation of such systems presents several challenges ranging from security to human factors. In addition to mitigating the issue of communication latency, autonomous systems might help with knowledge transfer and status updates during the mission life cycle. Aside from latency, other environmental factors, such as solar storms and systems failure, during the mission will add more communication challenges. Isolation for a longer duration can have psychological repercussions and consequently impact the mission performance. In addition, future missions to the Moon or Mars will require autonomous ambulatory care, autonomous advanced life support, autonomous surgical care, and integrating levels of autonomous advanced care in the form of medications, equipment, and training. This would account for monitoring the changes of the human body, and advanced life support autonomously, in contrast to the current terrestrial telemedicine. On-board assistants like CIMON represent an increasing interest in autonomous crew support systems for spaceflight operations. In order to maximize the development of such applications, machine learning processes and scenarios are best addressed in analog missions. This allows for a controlled environment to train system inputs and adaptive behavior to human interactions. Therefore, this serves as a practical model in terms of preparatory activities for future missions to the moon and Mars. Additionally, it is also important to have a methodology developed for efficient and secure coordination between the MCC and the crew members. This is done through a trade study of various systems and operations methodologies from chatbots to spaceflight analogues on Earth.",0,2018-01-01,Conference Paper,NA

Additionally, new discoveries and potential to improve â€œstate-of-the artâ€ medical procedures and protocols for training astronauts can be extrapolated for terrestrial â€œspin-offâ€ benefits where the challenges found in the extraordinary environment of space can be used to change current accepted paradigms on Earth. Our teams at Mars Academy USA have work in the development of teleanesthesia-telesurgery protocols using simulation-based learning platforms and real-time medical ""tele-triage"" operational procedures to train non-medical analog astronaut crews living in isolation and confinement in remote and extreme environments. Additionally, we tested feasibility for incorporating exponential technologies, such as, 3D printed medical tools and VRAR technologies as fully immersive virtual tools to support the training. This abstract will highlight previous and current studies to address the challenges in providing space surgery interventions and emergency medical management for non-medical or minimally-trained medical crews. The study utilized real-time communication between remote medical teams and on-site non-medical trained analog astronauts. We tested 3D printed medical tools, such as, surgical scalpels and â€œVapoJETâ„¢â€, a novel 3D printed portable anesthesia device which can potentially replace the bulky anesthesia equipment currently used for surgical procedures. During several Mars Academy USA (MAU) simulation missions in low fidelity analog environments, crews were familiarized in basic teleanesthesia-telesurgical protocols, such as, intubation procedures, use of VapoJETâ„¢ device, surgical suturing and debridement. Participants were observed by the remote medical teams composed of physicians and space medicine experts and scored using a modified OSAT (Objective Structured Assessment of Technical Skill). Participants were assessed on skills acquisition, surgical tool handling, skill retention, ease of integration of VRAR technologies. Video recordings were obtained for evaluation and participants completed subjective questionnaires. This project will continue in planned missions to mid-, and high-fidelity analog environments to Kilimanjaro, Everest basecamp, and Antarctica in 2019. In summary, such novel approaches offer creative methodologies and innovations and the development of a new paradigm to train non-medical individuals or minimally-trained medical persons not only just for extreme environments of Space but also in poverty-stricken communities or under-developed regions on Earth where lack of healthcare services and/limited access to professional caregivers are major challenges.",0,2018-01-01,Conference Paper,NA

Our aim is to help realise future, sustainable programme of space exploration, utilisation, and commercial development. We offer recommendations supporting the pursuit of technical goals drawn from a broad, forward-looking view of the technologies and systems needed including technical engineering, scientific, cultural, political, and societal. MDRS seeks to offer amenities to support likely Mars-planetary space activities and experience remote, isolated, and extreme habitability. Under today's operational constraints and an aging facility, the design and operation of MDRS could be much improved. For example, Crew 188 faced a hazardous environment in the form of a propane leak in the main habitat and a situation highlighting an inadequate response or protection mechanism; below-normal mission standard provisions including reduced water, food and up-link data streams; and the cessation of crew waste removal and water delivery services. Our responses to such challenges led to these recommendations sufficiently well focused to allow tangible progression and dramatic improvements over current MDRS capabilities to be realised in the foreseeable future. Future Mars crews will be expected to â€œrough it"" but they will also expect the autonomy, agency, and security of basic `luxury' provisions to create a home-away-from-home that supports a reasonable quality of working life. The Mars Society, and other analogues, could invest a small amount, for a large return on safety, simulation and science priority goals. A robust communications array, a thorough audit of essential health and safety provisions including emergency evacuation protocols; non-toxic waste disposal, Material Safety Data Sheets and up-to-date technical Engineering Schematics of the Habitat systems designs; and the advertised rations of food and water provisions, would ensure better health management of the crew and the local environment. Ultimately the real transformational value lies in the up-take of both public and private enterprise for sufficiently advancing our human capacity for technologies and systems for supporting a higher fidelity of simulation, and operational standards, for future exploration.",4,2018-01-01,Conference Paper,National Aeronautics and Space Administration

This ambitious goal demands a range of innovative technologies and reflections of the challenges we are facing on Earth. These reflections also apply to the field of Architectural and Building Technology. In order for humans to stay safely on the surface of Mars they need a radiation shielding habitat. Radiation is currently the greatest challenge to overcome. The use of In Situ Resources (ISRU) is critical to reduce the cost and can also lower the environmental impact of the mission. Literature study suggest that H2O provides an excellent shield against radiation. Moreover, ice is widely present on Mars. At the moment, little is known about the building properties of ice, especially in a Martian environment. However, building with ice does add quality to a living environment as it lets light through; as opposed to regolith or other stony materials. This paper presents the feasibility to build with ice to create a sustainable Martian habitat. Hence, a number of experiments were performed to test the feasibility of using ice as a building material. The result show that adding sodium chloride (NaCl) improves the mechanical properties of the ice. A further challenge to building a habitat on Mars is that it has to be built semi-remotely. The research singles out the use of robotic technology, which can perform all tasks necessary to build the habitat, ranging from mining the ice to assembling the building . Preliminary studies and experiments on Earth have been conducted on additive manufacturing techniques for sodium chloride ice. The main outcome is that the ice structure has a greater overall strength due to the freezing of the ice layer by layer. This technique also enables the possibility of crack repair during the building phase.",2,2018-01-01,Conference Paper,European Commission

Analysis of human data has been primarily from radiation accidents, radiotherapy, and the atomic bomb victims. The author published the general mathematical formula that predicts mortality probability as a function of dose rate and duration of exposure to acute ionizing radiation in humans on the basis of data presented by Cerveny et al., employing the author's mathematical probacent model. Further, the author applied the general formula to the data on dose versus cancer mortality risk published by the United Nations Scientific Committee on the effects of atomic radiation and other investigators to construct general formulas expressing a relationship between dose and solid cancer or leukemia mortality probability after exposure to acute low-dose ionizing radiation in humans on earth. There is a remarkable agreement between formula-derived and published values of dose and solid cancer or leukemia mortality probability (P > 0.99). In this study, the above mortality formulas are applied to the measurements of the Mars Science Laboratory spacecraft containing the Curiosity rover (2012-2013) in estimating radiation safety for astronauts in a future space flight to Mars planned by the National Aeronautics and Space Administration.

Identification of cladding materials with appropriate optical and physical properties that can withstand the high ultraviolet radiation, low pressure, and low temperature Martian environment is necessary for greenhouse design. The objective of this study was to evaluate the effects of simulated Mars environmental conditions on yield strength and light transmissivity of composites composed of a layer of 0.15 mm polyimide film (LaRC™CP1) attached to acrylic, polyvinyl chloride (PVC), or polycarbonate cladding materials. The University of Florida’s Mars Simulation Chamber (MSC) at Kennedy Space Center was utilized to expose material samples to simulated Mars environmental conditions. Changes in control versus exposed material sample transmissivities were measured using a spectroradiometer over the PAR range of wavelengths from 400 to 700 nm and material peak yield strengths were determined using an Instron universal testing machine. The overall results comparing pre- and post-exposure of samples to simulated Martian conditions in the MSC showed that the addition of a layer of polyimide did not benefit either the transmissivity or strength of polycarbonate cladding materials, but did show benefits in retaining transmissivity for PVC and in maintaining strength for acrylics exposed to Mars simulated environment. However, transmissivities of the plastics were reduced by the addition of protective layers of polyimide.",1,2018-01-01,Article,National Aeronautics and Space Administration

There are new evidences of the brain radiosensitivity even to low doses, mainly, due to radiovulnerability of hippocampal neurogenesis. According to our recent data, the changes of cognitive functioning are registered by Event Related Potentials (ERP) even at such very low radiation doses as 0.05 Gy (5 rad). This psychophysiological dose threshold is corresponding to radiation background and is dramatically lower of radiation exposure during space flights, especially long-term. Current challenges of modern society includes threat of radiation emergencies (radiation accident at nuclear power plants (NPP), nuclear war and nuclear terrorism (in particular, using of the radiological dispersal device, RDD), long-term space travel planning, specifically to Mars, etc. Psychophysiological technologies are very effective and safe for radiation effects detection. This chapter integrates our own 30-years’ experience and available data concerning changes spontaneous and evoked cerebral bioelectrical activity and cognitive functions in humans and animals following exposure to ionizing radiation. The contemporary radiobiological problems on human central nervous system (CNS) radiosensitivity and accelerated aging of the brain influenced by low doses of ionizing radiation is particularly discussed. A comprehensive analysis of psychophysiological evidence to support both hypotheses had been performed, and the necessity of a new research field (radiation psychophysiology) development was substantiated. The paper constitutes a thorough discussion on multiple psychophysiological effects at different exposure scenarios (acute radiation sickness (ARS), chronic exposure at low doses range, persons exposed in utero and at the age of 0-1 years). The cortico-limbic system, mainly of the left, dominant hemisphere is considered as a primary target for ionizing radiation which may be the neurophysiological basis of schizophrenia-like symptoms. A new possible radiocerebral effect in Wernicke’s area is shown. In the present chapter psychophysiological approach is considered in terms of its evolutionary perspective: routine EEG, quantitive EEG (qEEG), multisensory evoked potentials (SSEP, AEP, BAEP, VEP, SSR, VestEP), event-related potentials (ERP).

Galactic Cosmic Rays travel through the Martian atmosphere, producing a modified spectrum consisting of both primary and secondary particles at ground level. These particles produce an upward directed secondary particle spectrum as they interact with the Martian soil. Here we develop a method to distinguish the upward and downward directed particle fluxes in the Radiation Assessment Detector (RAD) instrument, verify it using data taken during the cruise to Mars, and apply it to data taken on the Martian surface. We use a combination of Geant4 and Planetocosmics modeling to find discrimination criteria for the flux directions. After developing models of the cruise phase and surface shielding conditions, we compare model-predicted values for the ratio of upward to downward flux with those found in RAD observation data. Given the quality of available information on Mars Science Laboratory spacecraft and rover composition, we find generally reasonable agreement between our models and RAD observation data. This demonstrates the feasibility of the method developed and tested here. We additionally note that the method can also be used to extend the measurement range and capabilities of the RAD instrument to higher energies.",1,2018-01-01,Article,National Aeronautics and Space Administration

In addition to the lack of gravity, the space environment includes exposure to charged remnants of supernova explosions beyond our solar system that travels with enormous velocities and energies, called HZE (high atomic number Z and energy E) particles and have the potential to disrupt chemical bonds within the human body though ionization. As a process, the collision of charged particles with matter is not new to physicists and biologists on Earth, and we have extensive data on low-linear energy transfer (LET) ionizing radiation from both accidental and deliberate exposures, dating back to the discovery of radioactive isotopes by Madame Curie. One of the primary morbidities associated with radiation exposure is the challenge to the hematopoietic system. The purpose of the current review is to discuss some of the basic tenants of hierarchical tissue systems by elaborating the effects of radiation damage to the hematopoietic stem cell and how terrestrial radiation and space radiation differ. Recent Findings: The last few decades of research in the field of space radiation, which consists of high-LET ions of 4He, 12C, 16O, 28Si, 48Ti, and 56Fe, and low-LET protons, have shown that there is a significantly more deleterious impact on the hematopoietic system by the high-LET ions compared to protons, X-rays, and γ-rays. Ground-based high-LET radiation experiments have shown not only in vitro and in vivo adverse effects on hematopoietic stem cells, but also that human leukemia can be induced in humanized mouse models. Summary: High-LET space radiation is more lethal to hematopoietic stem cells compared to low-LET radiation, but further research is required in order to understand the impact of high-LET radiation on hematopoietic malignancies. Most of the ground-based studies, because of technical difficulties and cost issues, have been carried out at high dose rates with only one ion species at a time. What remains to be clearly described, however, is the potential damage to the hematopoietic system from exposure to the more complex types of radiation at low dose rates that will occur during space travel and how space agencies can sufficiently protect our astronauts.",0,2017-12-01,Review,National Aeronautics and Space Administration

Mars500 was a unique, high-fidelity analogue of the psychological challenges of a 520-day manned mission to Mars. We aimed to explore the effect of musculoskeletal deconditioning on three outcome measures: (1) if lower limb muscle strength was reduced during the 520-day isolation; (2) if type I or II muscle fibres were differentially affected; and (3) whether any 70-day exercise interventions prevented any isolation-induced loss of strength. Methods: Six healthy male subjects (mean ± SEM) (34 ± 3 years; 1.76 ± 0.02 metres; 83.7 ± 4.8 kg) provided written, informed consent to participate. The subjects’ maximal voluntary contraction (MVC) was assessed isometrically in the calf (predominantly type I fibres), and maximal voluntary isokinetic force (MVIF) was assessed in the quadriceps/hamstrings (predominantly type II fibres) at 0.2 and 0.4 ms−1 using the Multifunctional Dynamometer for Space (MDS) at 35-day intervals throughout Mars500. Exercise interventions were completed 3–7 days/week throughout the 520-day isolation in a counterbalanced design excluding 142–177 days (rest period) and 251–284 days (simulated Mars landing). Exercise interventions included motorized treadmill running, non-motorized treadmill running, cycle ergometry, elastomer-based resistance exercise, whole-body vibration (WBV), and resistance exercise using MDS. Results: Calf MVC did not reduce across the 520-day isolation and MDS increased strength by 18% compared to before that of 70-day exercise intervention. In contrast, there was a significant bilateral loss of MVIF across the 520 days at both 0.2 ms−1 (R2 = 0.53; P = 0.001) and 0.4 ms−1 (0.4 ms−1; R2 = 0.42; P = 0.007). WBV (+ 3.7 and 8.8%) and MDS (+ 4.9 and 5.2%) afforded the best protection against isolation-induced loss of MVIF, although MDS was the only intervention to prevent bilateral loss of calf MVC and leg MVIF at 0.2 and 0.4 ms−1. Conclusions: Mars500 induced significant loss of quadriceps/hamstrings MVIF but not calf MVC. Collectively, these data suggest that muscles with predominantly type I fibres were affected less by isolation compared to type II dominant muscles. MDS and WBV afforded the best protection against isolation-induced loss of strength and thus may have virtue in exploration class missions.",13,2017-12-01,Article,European Space Agency

NASA needs to increase sterilization capabilities while reducing medical payload mass, volume, power, and costs. The medical payload contains small medical devices, such as scalpels and forceps; as well as disposable items, such as sanitary wipes. On the International Space Station, all carried medical equipment are disposable to ensure they are sanitary. This approach must be analyzed against a sanitize and reuse strategy for long duration missions. In order to address the problem, a cold plasma sterilization system capable of sterilizing small medical devices aboard a spacecraft is developed. System requirements were defined based on information gathered during literature review and input from NASA clients. Evaluation of the different cold plasma technologies, through the use of an analytical hierarchy process, resulted in selecting the Floating Electrode Dielectric Barrier Discharge configuration for the system. In this configuration, there are mechanical and electrical subsystems. The electrical subsystem contains a DC to DC converter unit, a high voltage switching unit, and a signal generator. The mechanical subsystem contains the application device, which is comprised of an outer polytetrafluorethylene housing, a copper electrode, a quartz dielectric, and electrical sealant. The system configuration of the device will generate pulsed plasma species in the discharge gap between itself and the substrate, in this case, K-12 strain Escherichia coli.

These radiation-induced cognitive impairments are accompanied by functional and structural changes including oxidative stress, neuroinflammation, and degradation of neuronal architecture. The molecular mechanisms that dictate CNS function are multifaceted and it is unclear how irradiation induces persistent alterations in the brain. Among those determinants of cognitive function are neuroepigenetic mechanisms that translate radiation responses into altered gene expression and cellular phenotype. In this study, we have demonstrated a correlation between epigenetic aberrations and adverse effects of space relevant irradiation on cognition. In cognitively impaired irradiated mice we observed increased 5-methylcytosine and 5-hydroxymethylcytosine levels in the hippocampus that coincided with increased levels of the DNA methylating enzymes DNMT3a, TET1 and TET3. By inhibiting methylation using 5-iodotubercidin, we demonstrated amelioration of the epigenetic effects of irradiation. In addition to protecting against those molecular effects of irradiation, 5-iodotubercidin restored behavioral performance to that of unirradiated animals. The findings of this study establish the possibility that neuroepigenetic mechanisms significantly contribute to the functional and structural changes that affect the irradiated brain and cognition.",29,2017-02-21,Article,National Aeronautics and Space Administration

Development of the medical system is being conducted in parallel with exploration mission architecture and vehicle design development. Successful implementation of the medical system in this environment will require a robust systems engineering approach to enable technical communication across communities to create a common mental model of the emergent engineering and medical systems. Model-Based Systems Engineering (MBSE) improves shared understanding of system needs and constraints between stakeholders and offers a common language for analysis. The ExMC SE team is using MBSE techniques to define operational needs, decompose requirements and architecture, and identify medical capabilities needed to support human exploration. Systems Modeling Language (SysML) is the specific language the SE team is utilizing, within an MBSE approach, to model the medical system functional needs, requirements, and architecture. Modeling methods are being developed through the practice of MBSE within the team, and tools are being selected to support meta-data exchange as integration points to other system models are identified.

Project SOLACE is a high-fidelity simulation of just such an emergency, beginning on the lunar surface and culminating in return to Earth. Central to the project is a medical ship designed to keep station in lunar orbit, readily available to retrieve injured astronauts from the surface, provide onboard medical care and transport them back to Earth. Per US military medical doctrine and its definition of “roles,” the medical ship is designed to provide role 2 and 3 care. Specifically, role 2 is defined as primary care, trauma management, and emergency medicine; role 3 encompasses resuscitation, initial wound surgery, damage control surgery, and postoperative treatment. Role 1, or first responder treatment, would be simulated on the lunar surface. This would stabilize the patient for ascent and provide as much critical care as possible during the “golden hour” of emergency medicine using portable diagnostic equipment, medication and basic hemostatic agents for trauma treatment. After lunar ascent and vehicle docking, the vehicle would begin Trans Earth Injection. During the postoperative period and transit, autonomous monitoring and responsive Total Parenteral Nutrition (TPN) would keep incapacitated crew stabilized and adequately nourished. SOLACE would ultimately return the crew to Earth, conducting simulations of role 2 and 3 care in transit. Using NASA’s Human Exploration of Mars Design Reference Architecture (DRA) 5.0 as a blueprint for future manned missions to deep space destinations, Project SOLACE would address acknowledged capability gaps, namely a “lifeboat” capability, artificial gravity, and remote medical care for astronauts. It would capitalize on the proximity of the Moon and cislunar space to provide a high-fidelity simulation of a deep space mission, resulting in critical system evaluation and feedback to better address those gaps. Further, SOLACE is designed as a “plug and play” module compatible with NASA’s interplanetary spacecraft architecture that supports interoperability and reusability, themes central to future missions. It uses the proposed Hercules lander to retrieve injured crew and the Trans Earth Injection (TEI) module resident in the Mars Transfer Vehicle design. Onboard medical equipment would be autonomous or teleoperated, with a gradual phase-out of the latter in favor of the former as technology matures.

While not the most important aspect of planning this cislunar outpost, there are several options that should be carefully considered since they may affect the crew as well as mission mass and volume. This study extends an earlier one, which focused on waste disposal options for a Mars Transit Vehicle. In that study, gasifying and venting trash along the way was found to noticeably reduce propellant needs and launch mass, whereas keeping processed trash on board in the form of radiation shielding tiles would significantly lower the crew’s radiation dose during a solar particle event. Another favorable strategy was packing trash in a used logistics module for disposal. Since the DSG does not need much propulsion to maintain its orbit and Orion will be present with its own radiation storm shelter at the Gateway, the driving factors of the waste disposal trade study are different than for the Mars mission. Besides reviewing the propulsion and radiation shielding factors, potential drivers such as mass, power, volume, crew time, and human factors (e.g. smell) were studied. Disposal options for DSG include jettison of a used logistics module containing waste after every human stay, jettison of the same logistics module after several missions once it is full, regular disposal of trash via an airlock, or gasifying waste products for easier disposal or reuse. Conversely, a heat melt compactor device could be used to remove water and stabilize trash into tiles which could be more compactly stored on board and used as radiation shielding. Equivalent system mass analysis is used to tally the benefits and costs (mass, volume, power, crew time) of each case on an equivalent mass basis. Other more subjective factors are also discussed. Recommendations are made for DSG and Mars mission waste disposal.",3,2017-01-01,Conference Paper,National Aeronautics and Space Administration

It is important to make sure such a mission concept would not bring any living microbes, which may possibly exist on Mars, back to Earth's environment. In order to ensure the isolation of Mars microbes from Earth's Atmosphere, a brazing sealing and sterilizing technique was proposed to break the Mars-to-Earth contamination path. Effectively, heating the brazing zone in high vacuum space and controlling the sample temperature for integrity are key challenges to the implementation of this technique. The break-thechain procedures for container configurations, which are being considered, were simulated by multi-physics finite element models. Different heating methods including induction and resistive/radiation were evaluated. The temperature profiles of Martian samples in a proposed container structure were predicted. The results show that the sealing and sterilizing process can be controlled such that the samples temperature is maintained below the level that may cause damage, and that the brazing technique is a feasible approach to breaking the contamination path.",0,2017-01-01,Conference Paper,California Institute of Technology

Modeling how shielding mitigates the dose accumulated by astronauts is an essential step toward reducing these risks. PREDICCS (Predictions of radiation from REleASE, EMMREM, and Data Incorporating the CRaTER, COSTEP, and other SEP measurements) is an online tool for the near real-time prediction of radiation exposure at Earth, the Moon, and Mars behind various levels of shielding. We compare shielded dose rates from PREDICCS with dose rates from the Cosmic Ray Telescope for the Effects of Radiation (CRaTER) onboard the Lunar Reconnaissance Orbiter (LRO) at the Moon and from the Radiation Assessment Detector (RAD) on the Mars Science Laboratory (MSL) during its cruise phase to Mars for five solar events in 2012 when Earth, MSL, and Mars were magnetically well connected. Calculations of the accumulated dose demonstrate a reasonable agreement between PREDICCS and RAD ranging from as little as 2% difference to 54%. We determine mathematical relationships between shielding levels and accumulated dose. Lastly, the gradient of accumulated dose between Earth and Mars shows that for the largest of the five solar events, lunar missions require aluminum shielding between 1.0 g cm-2 and 5.0 g cm-2 to prevent radiation exposure from exceeding the 30-day limits for lens and skin. The limits were not exceeded near Mars.",2,2017-01-01,Article,National Science Foundation

Of particular concern is the potential for cosmic radiation exposure to compromise critical decision making during normal operations or under emergency conditions in deep space. Rodents exposed to cosmic radiation exhibit persistent hippocampal and cortical based performance decrements using six independent behavioral tasks administered between separate cohorts 12 and 24 weeks after irradiation. Radiation-induced impairments in spatial, episodic and recognition memory were temporally coincident with deficits in executive function and reduced rates of fear extinction and elevated anxiety. Irradiation caused significant reductions in dendritic complexity, spine density and altered spine morphology along medial prefrontal cortical neurons known to mediate neurotransmission interrogated by our behavioral tasks. Cosmic radiation also disrupted synaptic integrity and increased neuroinflammation that persisted more than 6 months after exposure. Behavioral deficits for individual animals correlated significantly with reduced spine density and increased synaptic puncta, providing quantitative measures of risk for developing cognitive impairment. Our data provide additional evidence that deep space travel poses a real and unique threat to the integrity of neural circuits in the brain.",83,2016-10-10,Article,National Aeronautics and Space Administration

This study evaluated whether Mars simulation crewmembers of the Hawai'i Space Exploration Analog and Simulation (HI-SEAS) II mission with no prior surgical experience could utilize acrylonitrile butadiene styrene (ABS) thermoplastic surgical instruments FDM 3D printed on Earth to complete simulated surgical tasks. METHODS: This study sought to examine the feasibility of using 3D printed surgical tools when the primary crew medical officer is incapacitated and the back-up crew medical officer must conduct a surgical procedure during a simulated extended space mission. During a 4 mo duration ground-based analog mission, five simulation crewmembers with no prior surgical experience completed 16 timed sets of simulated prepping, draping, incising, and suturing tasks to evaluate the relative speed of using four ABS thermoplastic instruments printed on Earth compared to conventional instruments. RESULTS: All four simulated surgical tasks were successfully performed using 3D printed instruments by Mars simulation crewmembers with no prior surgical experience. There was no substantial difference in time to completion of simulated tasks with control vs. 3D printed sponge stick, towel clamp, scalpel handle, and toothed forceps. DISCUSSION: These limited findings support further investigation into the creation of an onboard digital catalog of validated 3D printable surgical instrument design files to support autonomous, crew-administered healthcare on Mars missions. Future work could include addressing sterility, biocompatibility, and having astronaut crew medical officers test a wider range of surgical instruments printed in microgravity during actual surgical procedures.",8,2016-09-01,Article,NA
84988566064,Simulating the Lunar Environment: Partial Weightbearing and High-LET Radiation-Induce Bone Loss and Increase Sclerostin-Positive Osteocytes,Macias B.,NA,Radiation Research,186,3,254-263,10.1667/RR13579.1,"Exploration missions to the Moon or Mars will expose astronauts to galactic cosmic radiation and low gravitational fields. Exposure to reduced weightbearing and radiation independently result in bone loss. However, no data exist regarding the skeletal consequences of combining low-dose, high-linear energy transfer (LET) radiation and partial weightbearing. We hypothesized that simulated galactic cosmic radiation would exacerbate bone loss in animals held at one-sixth body weight (G/6) without radiation exposure. Female BALB/cByJ four-month-old mice were randomly assigned to one of the following treatment groups: 1 gravity (1G) control; 1G with radiation; G/6 control; and G/6 with radiation. Mice were exposed to either silicon-28 or X-ray radiation. 28Si radiation (300 MeV/nucleon) was administered at acute doses of 0 (sham), 0.17 and 0.5 Gy, or in three fractionated doses of 0.17 Gy each over seven days. X radiation (250 kV) was administered at acute doses of 0 (sham), 0.17, 0.5 and 1 Gy, or in three fractionated doses of 0.33 Gy each over 14 days. Bones were harvested 21 days after the first exposure. Acute 1 Gy X-ray irradiation during G/6, and acute or fractionated 0.5 Gy 28Si irradiation during 1G resulted in significantly lower cancellous mass [percentage bone volume/total volume (%BV/TV), by microcomputed tomography]. In addition, G/6 significantly reduced %BV/TV compared to 1G controls. When acute X-ray irradiation was combined with G/6, distal femur %BV/TV was significantly lower compared to G/6 control. Fractionated X-ray irradiation during G/6 protected against radiation-induced losses in %BV/TV and trabecular number, while fractionated 28Si irradiation during 1G exacerbated the effects compared to single-dose exposure. Impaired bone formation capacity, measured by percentage mineralizing surface, can partially explain the lower cortical bone thickness. Moreover, both partial weightbearing and 28Si-ion exposure contribute to a higher proportion of sclerostin-positive osteocytes in cortical bone. Taken together, these data suggest that partial weightbearing and low-dose, high-LET radiation negatively impact maintenance of bone mass by lowering bone formation and increasing bone resorption. The impaired bone formation response is associated with sclerostin-induced suppression of Wnt signaling. Therefore, exposure to low-dose, high-LET radiation during long-duration spaceflight missions may reduce bone formation capacity, decrease cancellous bone mass and increase bone resorption. Future countermeasure strategies should aim to restore mechanical loads on bone to those experienced in one gravity. Moreover, low-doses of high-LET radiation during long-duration spaceflight should be limited or countermeasure strategies employed to mitigate bone loss.",14,2016-09-01,Article,National Science Foundation

This study demonstrates an updated atmospheric radiation model that uses new dose tables to improve the accuracy of the modeled dose rates. Additionally, a method for computing geomagnetic cutoffs is incorporated into the model in order to account for location-dependent effects of the magnetosphere. Newly available measurements of atmospheric dose rates from instruments aboard commercial aircraft and high-altitude balloons enable us to evaluate the accuracy of the model in computing atmospheric dose rates. When compared to the available observations, the model seems to be reasonably accurate in modeling atmospheric radiation levels, overestimating airline dose rates by an average of 20%, which falls within the uncertainty limit recommended by the International Commission on Radiation Units and Measurements (ICRU). Additionally, measurements made aboard high-altitude balloons during simultaneous launches from New Hampshire and California provide an additional comparison to the model. We also find that the newly incorporated geomagnetic cutoff method enables the model to represent radiation variability as a function of location with sufficient accuracy.",4,2016-09-01,Article,National Science Foundation

In this work we investigate the possible radiation exposures to crews of missions on the surface of Mars, from such an event. In this work we use the HZETRN radiation transport code, originally developed at NASA Langley Research Center, and the Computerized Anatomical Male and Female human geometry models to estimate exposures for a variety of aluminum shield areal densities similar to those provided by a spacesuit, surface lander, and permanent habitat on the Martian surface.

85088356385,Realization of a two-synodic-period earth-mars cycler,Naeije M.C.,NA,"2016 AIAA Guidance, Navigation, and Control Conference",NA,NA,NA,10.2514/6.2016-0628,"To cater to prolonged exploration of Mars, an infrastructure is necessary to provide crew and supplies on a regular basis. Cyclers, trajectories that are de ected through gravita- tional swingbys to repeatedly visit a limited set of planets, provide such an infrastructure, of which the S1L1 Earth-Mars cycler is particularly attractive due to low fly by velocities and low ΔV required. This paper aims to improve the fidelity of this two-synodic-period cycler by firstly reconstructing the original proposed cycler in a model with realistic po- sitions and velocities of the planets by solving Lambert's problem for each leg between the swingbys, secondly by optimizing the unperturbed trajectory, and thirdly subjecting the optimized trajectory to third-body perturbations and solar radiation pressure, which are small but persistent accelerations that accrue over decades and would require orbit maintenance in the form of extra ΔV . The reconstructed cycler trajectory shows the shortcomings of the reference trajectory. A dispersion analysis on the swingby dates revealed that a variation of ±1 day already causes significant discrepancies in fly by velocity and altitude. We then adopt the reconstructed more realistic trajectory as reference for the optimization. This new reference has average Earth and Mars arrivals V1 of 5.4 km/s and 5.6 km/s, respectively, and needs to be powered with an average ΔV of 40 m/s per leg (not purely ballistic anymore). Sensitivity analysis shows that the trajectory result is very sensitive to the initial state. Multiple solution vector formulations are tested and only a corrected Lambert solution was able to consistently have a sufficient percentage of successful trajectories. Then the trajectory is subjected to orbit optimization using Differential Evolution bring- ing the solution closer to the original perturbed S1L1 cycler in terms of smaller total ΔV . Different penalty strategies are investigated to further minimize the needed ΔV s. At the same time this also changed the Earth-Mars transit times. The most favorable compromise is subsequently subjected to third-body perturbations (Sun, Earth, Mars, when spacecraft not in their respective SOI) and solar-radiation pressure, resulting in a more faithful total ΔV budget.",0,2016-01-01,Conference Paper,NA

RESULTS: A number of psychological and interpersonal issues emerged that are relevant in planning for such a planetary trip. Most of these issues are related to the extreme distances involved; the resulting delay in communication between the crewmembers and supportive personnel on Earth; the increased autonomy that the crew will experience; the sense of loneliness and isolation that will occur; and the possible negative effects of the Earth-out-of-view phenomenon. CONCLUSIONS: Possible countermeasures for dealing with psychological and interpersonal issues during a Mars expedition will be discussed.

85016471400,"A feasible, near-term approach to human stasis for long-duration deep space missions",Schaffer M.,NA,"Proceedings of the International Astronautical Congress, IAC",NA,NA,NA,NA,"The idea of suspended animation for interstellar human spaceflight has often been posited as a promising far-term solution for long-duration voyages. A means of full cryo-preservation and restoration remains a long way off still. However, recent medical progress is quickly advancing our ability to induce torpor, a deep sleep hibernation-like state, in humans for extended periods of time. The authors propose that torpor can be used as a means of achieving human stasis for long-duration deep space by combining two existing, common, and well-understood medical procedures: Therapeutic Hypothermia (TH) and Total Parenteral Nutrition (TPN). Therapeutic Hypothermia (TH) is a medical treatment in which a patient's body temperature is lowered to 32C to 34C (89F to 93F) in order to slow the body's metabolism. TH is being used routinely in hospitals around the world with broad application to reduce the impact of traumatic body injuries. Total Parenteral Nutrition (TPN) is a medical process in which patients are fed intravenously by nutritional fluids delivered via a central venous catheter. Long-term TPN is often used to treat patients suffering the extended consequences of an accident, surgery, or digestive disorder. The authors began investigating the use of torpor for human stasis in 2013 through a study funded by the NASA Innovated Advanced Concepts (NIAC) program. In papers presented at IAC 2014 and IAC 2015, the authors presented the results of initial feasibility and systems-level impact studies of applying this medical technology to near-term exploration class missions to Mars (IAC-14-A5.2.8), and to far-term settlement-class missions to Mars (IAC-15-A5.2.12). This paper focuses on the medical perspective of applying TH and TPN to long-duration deep space missions. The authors have assembled a team of medical experts in multiple medical specialties to access the feasibility of long-term use of both TH and TPN, overcoming the long-term medical complications that may occur, and advantages of placing the crew in hibernation. Detailed descriptions of the current state-of-the-art for each process, recommendations from the medical team, and discussions of medical advantages and potential medical challenges are presented.

85016463077,Cycling pathways to occupy mars via lunar resources,Aldrin B.,Cycler | Lunar resource | Mars colonization,"Proceedings of the International Astronautical Congress, IAC",NA,NA,NA,NA,"Cycling trajectories between the Earth and Mars could provide a human space transportation system that benefits from the reusability of a cycler vehicle. Such cycler vehicles, once placed in their heliocentric orbits can provide ballistic or near-ballistic trajectories that continue on their own momentum (or nearly so). The concept of cycler trajectories has been so well-established that new architecture warrants a name which we have coined, ""Cycling Pathway to Occupy Mars."" Since a cycler vehicle is placed in its permanent orbit as a single investment, it can be designed to provide protection, safety, and comfort to the astronauts during their interplanetary transit to Mars. A second important consideration is the potential of using lunar ice to provide rocket propellant that can be used to transfer lunar colonists on to a hyperbolic rendezvous with a cycler vehicle. Lunar ice can of course provide the most essential human nutrients, water and oxygen. Current estimates indicate that the amount of water may be 5% by mass of the lunar regolith contained in the permanently-shaded regions (PSRs) near the South Pole. Two likely craters for these resources are Shackleton and Cabeus. Besides providing propellant from the Moon for hyperbolic transfer for the Mars cycler, the purpose of a lunar base is to address human challenges that must surmounted to establish a permanent human presence on Mars. Prominent among these challenges are protection against space radiation, maintenance of musculoskeletal fitness in low-g, and preservation of mental and psychological health. In the current effort, the objective is to establish an international lunar base by developing the cislunar ""plus"" proving ground missions at the Moon that paves the way for international colonization of Mars. From the lunar base, a crew of four to eight astronauts (two landers with up to four crew members per lander) are sent to Mars every synodic period using Earth-Mars ""S1L1 cycler"" trajectory, with the first crew reaching Mars in 2037. The first activity can start as early as 2018 when prototype habitation (exploration modules or XMs) ready for tests in LEO, followed by tests in deep space environments, and lunar surface, for long-term use with minimal maintenance, while only being crewed for six months every 4 2/7 years.

MATERIALS AND METHODS: The study included 128 people, 112 male Chornobyl clean up workers in 1986-1987 with the records of radiation doses available in Clinical and Epidemiological Registry (CER) of State Institution «National Research Center for Radiation Medicine of the National Academy of Medical Sciences of Ukraine» (NRCRM) (study group) and 16 unexposed persons due to the Chornobyl disaster (control group). At the time of the survey the average age of clean up workers (M ± SD) was (57.3 ± 5.9) years, range 44-65 years, and of unex posed persons was (57.3 ± 6.5) years, range 44-65 years. Radiation doses were within the range 0.0002-1.23 Gy, with the arithmetic mean dose (M ± SD) of (0.2 ± 0.2) Gy and the geometric mean dose of 0.1 Gy. RESULTS: The radiocerebral effect in the projection of the left posterior superior temporal gyrus (Wernicke’s area) proportionally to the radiation dose with the possible threshold of 0.05 Gy of total irradiation was revealed, with increasing radiation dose cognitive component P300 amplitude reduces and its latency period (LP) increases, espe cially at doses > 0.3-0.5 Gy. At doses > 0.5 Gy the functional relationship with the radiation dose for LP P300 increase in the projection of Wernicke’s area (r = 0.9; p = 0.027) has been found. CONCLUSIONS: The neurophysiological features detected are fully consistent with hypotheses both on radiosensitiv ity of human central nervous system and accelerated aging of the brain under the influence of small doses of ionizing radiation, and have questioned the feasibility of long term manned space flights (including Mars) until the development of adequate radiation hygiene standardization for space crews and invention of means for radiation protection of space flights.

For example, the long-term health effects of living and working in a microgravity environment can currently only be experienced in an orbiting spacecraft. Radiation exposure, however, is a significant concern in space but is also an issue in certain terrestrial environments. Despite similarities with terrestrial radiation, space-based radiation is rarely encountered in an Earth environment. In fact, there are only a few locations around the world where space radiation can even be produced for research purposes. Although many long-term studies on the health effects of terrestrial radiation have been performed, there remain significant uncertainties as to whether or not Earth-based radiation can be used as a model for space-based radiation. Some of this uncertainty rests with the limited human-applicable radiation data acquired in space environments beyond Low Earth Orbit. Recent publications documenting radiation measurements from NASA&#39;s Mars Science Laboratory have significantly added to the understanding of estimated total radiation exposure doses during a human Mars mission. Despite the uncertainties regarding these estimates and the use of Earth-based radiation as a model, it is known that there are unquestionable health risks associated with long-term exposure to space radiation including tissue damage, increased cancer risk, acute radiation syndrome, central nervous system defects, and many others. This paper will discuss these health risks, the differences between terrestrial and space radiation, recent knowledge developments regarding space radiation, and also potential countermeasures for protecting future human spaceflight explorers.",1,2016-01-01,Review,NA
84995685497,Reducing cost by extending crew stay for missions to the moon and mars,Plata D.,NA,"AIAA Space and Astronautics Forum and Exposition, SPACE 2016",NA,NA,NA,NA,"There are a large number of strategies for reducing overall mission cost for crewed missions. An overview of some of these approaches is considered. The specific focus of this paper is how cost fcould be reduced by extending crew stay on the Moon and Mars. By so doing, the transportation cost for rotating crew can be reduced while also reducing the risk of loss of crew. We propose the use of the Earth Return Option where biomedical criteria indicate whether crew would need to return at the upcoming Earth return window or if they can choose to extend their stay until the following window. This could be done by ensuring that they have sufficient supplies, maintaining reliable life support systems, protecting from radiation and the effects of micro and hypogravity, and if possible, selecting crew whose social status allows for extended stays. We identify water-bearing supplies as a convenient way of reducing radiation exposure while in transit to Mars and regolith piled on top of habitats while on the surface of the Moon or Mars. While there, we propose the use of a centrifuge within a shielded habitat for several hours a day. The authors found that we could successfully conduct a variety of sedentary activities while spinning at the rate that would provide 1 g on the Moon. Finally, we suggest that any crew on a mission exceeding two years or so would ideally not have dependent children or a spouse back on Earth. We believe that the ideal initial crew may be couples without dependent children. We conclude that, by utilizing the interventions that this paper suggests, crew stay can be extended resulting in an overall lower mission cost and risk.",0,2016-01-01,Conference Paper,NA

HZE particles are usually considered those having Z > 1, though sometimes Z > 2 is meant. Transport physics is governed by two types of interactions, electromagnetic (ionization energy loss) and nuclear. Models of transport, such as those used in treatment planning and space mission planning must account for both effects in detail. The theory of electromagnetic interactions is well developed, but nucleus-nucleus collisions are so complex that no fundamental physical theory currently describes them. Instead, interaction models are generally anchored to experimental data, which in some areas are far from complete. The lack of fundamental physics knowledge introduces uncertainties in the calculations of exposures and their associated risks. These uncertainties are greatly compounded by the much larger uncertainties in biological response to HZE particles. In this article, we discuss the role of nucleus-nucleus interactions in heavy charged particle therapy and in deep space, where astronauts will receive a chronic low dose from galactic cosmic rays (GCRs) and potentially higher short-term doses from sporadic, unpredictable solar energetic particles (SEPs). GCRs include HZE particles; SEPs typically do not and we, therefore, exclude them from consideration in this article. Nucleus-nucleus collisions can result in the breakup of heavy ions into lighter ions. In space, this is generally beneficial because dose and dose equivalent are, on the whole, reduced in the process. The GCRs can be considered a radiation field with a significant high-LET component; when they pass through matter, the high-LET component is attenuated, at the cost of a slight increase in the low-LET component. Not only are the standard measures of risk reduced by fragmentation, but it can be argued that fragmentation also reduces the uncertainties in risk calculations by shifting the LET distribution toward one that is more concentrated at low LET, where biological effects are better understood. We review previous work in this area, including measurements made by the Radiation Assessment Detector during its journey to Mars and while on the surface of Mars aboard the Curiosity rover. Transport of HZE is also critically important in heavy-ion therapy, as it is necessary to know the details of the radiation field at the treatment site. This field is substantially modified compared to the incident pure (or nearly pure) ion beam by the same mechanisms of energy loss and nuclear fragmentation that pertain to the transport of space radiation.",16,2016-01-01,Review,U.S. Department of Energy

Combined analysis of these data and results of “Mirror coordinograph” test showed invariance of IWSs no matter whether a task is complicated or simple. Operators demonstrating the “control” strategy are characterized by high initial mobilization readiness. Their reliability demands great physiological resources (high “cost”).

85006201916,Intubation after rapid sequence induction performed by non-medical personnel during space exploration missions: A simulation pilot study in a Mars analogue environment,Komorowski M.,Anaesthesia | Medical training | Simulation | Space exploration | Space medicine,Extreme Physiology and Medicine,4,1,NA,10.1186/s13728-015-0038-5,"Background: The question of the safety of anaesthetic procedures performed by non anaesthetists or even by non physicians has long been debated. We explore here this question in the hypothetical context of an exploration mission to Mars. During future interplanetary space missions, the risk of medical conditions requiring surgery and anaesthetic techniques will be significant. On Earth, anaesthesia is generally performed by well accustomed personnel. During exploration missions, onboard medical expertise might be lacking, or the crew doctor could become ill or injured. Telemedical assistance will not be available. In these conditions and as a last resort, personnel with limited medical training may have to perform lifesaving procedures, which could include anaesthesia and surgery. The objective of this pilot study was to test the ability for unassisted personnel with no medical training to perform oro-tracheal intubation after a rapid sequence induction on a simulated deconditioned astronaut in a Mars analogue environment. The experiment made use of a hybrid simulation model, in which the injured astronaut was represented by a torso manikin, whose vital signs and hemodynamic status were emulated using a patient simulator software. Only assisted by an interactive computer tool (PowerPoint® presentation), five participants with no previous medical training completed a simplified induction of general anaesthesia with intubation. Results: No major complication occurred during the simulated trials, namely no cardiac arrest, no hypoxia, no cardiovascular collapse and no failure to intubate. The study design was able to reproduce many of the constraints of a space exploration mission. Conclusions: Unassisted personnel with minimal medical training and familiarization with the equipment may be able to perform advanced medical care in a safe and efficient manner. Further studies integrating this protocol into a complete anaesthetic and surgical scenario will provide valuable input in designing health support systems for space exploration missions.",7,2015-11-01,Article,NA

Using energetic proton flux data from the High Energy Telescope and Low Energy Telescope instruments aboard STEREO A together with the Earth-Moon-Mars Radiation Environment Module, we compute dose rates and accumulated doses during the event for both skin/eye and blood forming organs using four physically relevant levels of shielding. For spacesuit equivalent shielding, we compute a peak skin/eye dose rate of 1970 cGy-Eq/d, a value far greater than those of the 2003 Halloween storms or the January and March solar energetic particle events of 2012. However, due to the relative brevity of the event, the resulting accumulated dose was just 383 cGy-Eq, which is more aligned with the total doses of the 2003 Halloween and 2012 January/March events. Additionally, we use dose rates at STEREO B and Lunar Reconnaissance Orbiter/Cosmic Ray Telescope for the Effects of Radiation (LRO/CRaTER) during the event to show how the radiation impact is affected by the position of the ICME relative to the observer. Specifically, we find that the energetic particle event associated with the local shock and ICME passage at STEREO A caused greatly enhanced dose rates when compared to STEREO B and LRO/CRaTER, which were longitudinally distant from the ICME. The STEREO A/B dose rates used here will soon be made available to the community as a tool for studying the energetic particle radiation of solar events from different longitudes as a part of NASA's Heliophysics Virtual Observatories and on the Predictions of radiation from REleASE, EMMREM, and Data Incorporating CRaTER, COSTEP, and other SEP measurements (PREDICCS) and CRaTER websites.",8,2015-09-01,Article,National Science Foundation

With renewed interest in manned missions to Mars, there is a clear need to develop and analyze radiation protection architectures. The Mars scenario was selected due to its relatively high likelihood, the robust body of background data available, and the adaptability of the analytic methods, concepts, and trade spaces to other planetary missions. An executable model was developed to assess the cost and effectiveness of 14 candidate solar warning architectures. Candidates were evaluated and compared based upon two performance metrics: warning time and solar coverage. The cost of each architecture was assessed by estimating the total dry mass of all required components. Relation of the performance metric of each architecture to its estimated cost enabled construction of a Pareto frontier of design options using multiattribute utility theory to combine performance metrics into an overall 'best value' solution.

To predict the cruise radiation environment related to future human missions to Mars, the correlation between solar modulation potential and the dose rate measured by the Radiation Assessment Detector (RAD) has been analyzed and empirical models have been employed to quantify this correlation. Methods. The instrument RAD, onboard Mars Science Laboratory's (MSL) rover Curiosity, measures a broad spectrum of energetic particles along with the radiation dose rate during the 253-day cruise phase as well as on the surface of Mars. With these first ever measurements inside a spacecraft from Earth to Mars, RAD observed the impulsive enhancement of dose rate during solar particle events as well as a gradual evolution of the galactic cosmic ray (GCR) induced radiation dose rate due to the modulation of the primary GCR flux by the solar magnetic field, which correlates with long-term solar activities and heliospheric rotation. Results. We analyzed the dependence of the dose rate measured by RAD on solar modulation potentials and estimated the dose rate and dose equivalent under different solar modulation conditions. These estimations help us to have approximate predictions of the cruise radiation environment, such as the accumulated dose equivalent associated with future human missions to Mars. Conclusions. The predicted dose equivalent rate during solar maximum conditions could be as low as one-fourth of the current RAD cruise measurement. However, future measurements during solar maximum and minimum periods are essential to validate our estimations.",25,2015-05-01,Article,National Aeronautics and Space Administration

Are we ready? Transportation, entry, landing, and surface operations have been successfully demonstrated for robotic missions. However, for human missions, there are significant, potentially show-stopping issues. These issues, called Strategic Knowledge Gaps (SKGs), are the unanswered questions concerning long duration exploration Beyond low Earth Orbit (BEO). The gaps represent a risk of loss of life or mission and because they require extended exposure to the weightless environment outside of earth's protective geo-magnetic field, they cannot be resolved on Earth or on the International Space Station (ISS). Placing a laboratory at a relatively close and stable lunar Distant Retrograde Orbit (DRO) provides an accessible location with the requisite environmental conditions for conducting SKG research and testing mitigation solutions. Configurations comprised of multiple 3 m and 4.3 m diameter modules have been studied but the most attractive solution uses elements of the human Mars launch vehicle or Space Launch System (SLS) for a Mars proving ground laboratory. A shortened version of an SLS hydrogen propellant tank creates a Skylab-like pressure vessel that flies fully outfitted on a single launch. This not only offers significant savings by incorporating SLS pressure vessel development costs but avoids the expensive ISS approach using many launches with substantial on-orbit assembly before becoming operational. One of the most challenging SKGs is crew radiation protection; this is why SKG laboratory research is combined with Mars transit habitat systems development. Fundamentally, the two cannot be divorced because using the habitat systems for protection requires actual hardware geometry and material properties intended to contribute to shielding effectiveness. The SKGs are difficult problems. The solutions to these problems are not obvious; they require integrated, iterative, and multi-disciplinary development. A lunar DRO lab built from SLS elements enables an early and representative transit habitat test bed necessary for closing gaps before sending humans on a 1,000-day Mars mission.",3,2015-01-01,Conference Paper,NA

To accomplish these goals, large structures will be necessary to transport crew and logistics in the initial stages, and NASA will need to keep the crew and the vehicle safe during transport and any surface activities. One of the major challenges of deep space travel is the space radiation environment and its impacts on the crew, the electronics, and the vehicle materials. The primary radiation from the sun (solar particle events) and from outside the solar system (galactic cosmic rays) interact with materials of the vehicle. These interactions lead to some of the primary radiation being absorbed, being modified, or producing secondary radiation (primarily neutrons). With all vehicles, the high energy primary radiation is of most concern. However, with larger vehicles that have large shielding masses, there is more opportunity for secondary radiation production, and this secondary radiation can be significant enough to cause concern. When considering surface operations, there is also a secondary radiation source from the surface of the planet, known as albedo, with neutrons being one of the most significant species. Given new vehicle designs for deep space and Mars missions, the secondary radiation environment and the implications of that environment is currently not well understood. Thus, several studies are necessary to fill the knowledge gaps of this secondary radiation environment. In this paper, we put forth the initial steps to increasing our understanding of neutron production from large vehicles by comparing the neutron production resulting from our radiation transport codes and providing a preliminary validation of our results against flight data. This paper will review the details of these results and discuss the finer points of the analysis.",1,2015-01-01,Conference Paper,NA

A means of full cryo-preservation and restoration remains a long way off still. However, recent medical progress is quickly advancing our ability to induce deep sleep states (i.e. torpor) with significantly reduced metabolic rates for humans over extended periods of time. Since 2013 the authors have been investigating the feasibility and systems-level impact of applying this medical technology to human spaceflight, specifically for human missions to Mars. In a paper presented at IAC 2014 (IAC-14-A5.2.8), the authors presented the results of an initial study funded by the NASA Innovative Advanced Concepts (NIAC) program that considered the application of torpor-enabled habitats to near-Term, exploration-class missions to Mars. Based on the promising results of that initial study, the authors have begun to consider the impact of torpor-enabled habitats to far term, settlement-class missions to Mars. This paper summarizes the results of a design study of a torpor-enabled 100- person deep space habitat for transporting a crew of long-Term explorers to Mars. The Mars Transfer Habitat (MTH) is comprised of three habitats modules, a nuclear power-generation module, and several connection node modules. Two of the habitat modules are identical: habitation for 48 passengers each, kept in an unconscious torpor state for the duration of the transit from Earth to Mars orbit. The third module provides the living quarters for the active crew of 4 who serve as caretakers for the others. The total mass of the MTH is 200t, and it requires 300 kW of electrical power.

This Evolvable Mars Campaign may include a human mission to Phobos before sending a crew to the surface of Mars. Phobos has many advantages as a potential stepping-stone on the way to Mars. A human mission to Phobos would demonstrate the capability to conduct long missions in interplanetary space and provide the crew with self-reliant operational experience in the vicinity of Mars. Phobos may have abundant local resources such as ice that could be extracted and used to produce propellants and consumables to support Mars exploration. The Martian moon could shield a habitat on its surface from space radiation. Astronauts on Phobos could teleoperate robotic systems on the surface of Mars to prepare landing sites and deploy equipment for follow-on human missions. It is widely accepted by the science community that there are Mars surface materials on Phobos resulting from the ejecta of meteorite impacts on Mars, and astronauts could collect samples for return to Earth. This paper will give an overview of the Evolvable Mars Campaign, describe a robotic precursor mission to Phobos that could be conducted in the mid-2020s, and discuss mission concepts for sending humans to Phobos and exploring its surface.

84991490872,Tritel satellite version silicon detector telescope development for the eseo spacecraft,Zabori B.,NA,"Proceedings of the International Astronautical Congress, IAC",1,NA,176-183,NA,"One of the many risks of long-duration space flights (e.g. International Space Station expeditions, satellite flights, future lunar or Mars-missions, etc.) is the excessive exposure to cosmic radiation. The dose equivalent in orbit may be two orders of magnitude higher than that under the shield of Earth's atmosphere. Due to significant spatial and temporal changes in the cosmic radiation field, radiation measurements with advanced dosimetric instruments on board space vehicles and satellites are extremely important. Since dose equivalent, which characterizes the stochastic biological effects of the radiation, was defined in terms of a LET (linear energy transfer)-dependent quality factor, determining the LET spectrum and the quality factor of cosmic radiation is necessary. For this reason, the development of a three dimensional silicon detector telescope (TRITEL) with almost uniform sensitivity got underway in Centre for Energy Research, Hungarian Academy of Sciences. The instrument comprising three mutually orthogonal, fully depleted passivated implanted planar silicon (PIPS) detector pairs is capable of providing the LET spectrum and the average quality factor of the radiation as well as the absorbed dose and dose equivalent. Due to the three orthogonal telescopes an assessment of the anisotropy of the radiation field might be also possible. Since the spectrum of the trapped radiation inside the South Atlantic Anomaly (SAA) is significantly softer, it is worth collecting the SAA and non-SAA spectra separately. ESEO (European Student Earth Orbiter) is an education satellite project of the ESA Education Office. Its aim is to place a spacecraft in sun-synchronous, polar orbit, to provide measurements of the radiation environment in low Earth orbit and to test technologies for future education satellite missions.

The following topics are described: 1) The charged particle telescope and the experiment Liulin-MO for measuring the radiation environment on board the ExoMars 2016 Trace Gas Orbiter satellite as a part of the Fine Resolution Epithermal Neutron Detector (FREND) and 2) Liulin-ML experiment and in- strument for investigating the radiation environment on Mars as a part of the active detector of neutrons and gamma rays (ADRON) on the Russian surface platform for ExoMars 2018 mission. Liulin detectors will be used in combina- tion with the neutron detectors to study the radiation conditions both from charged particles and neutrons during the cruise phase, in Mars orbit and on the surface of Mars.",3,2015-01-01,Article,NA

The aim of the present study is to identify crewmembers' behavioral profiles for better understanding group dynamics during a 520-day isolation and confinement of the international crew (n=6) participating to the ""Mars-500"" interplanetary simulation. We propose to correlate data from PSPA (Personal Self-Perception and Attitudes) computerized test, sociometric questionnaires and color choices test (Luscher test) used to measure anxiety levels, with data of video analysis during group discussion (GD) and breakfast time (BT). All the procedures were implemented monthly - GD, or twice a month - BT. Firstly, we used descriptive statistics for displaying quantitative subjects' behavioral profiles, supplied with a software based-solution: the Observer XT®. Secondly, we used Spearmen's nonparametric correlation analysis. The results show that for each subject, the level of non-verbal behavior (""visual interactions"", ""object interactions"", ""body interaction"", ""personal actions"", ""facial expressions"", and ""collateral acts"") is higher than the level of verbal behavior (""interpersonal communication in Russian"", and ""interpersonal communication in English""). From the video analyses, dynamics profiles over months are different between the crewmembers. From the correlative analyses, we found highly negative correlations between anxiety and interpersonal communications; and between the sociometric parameter ""popularity in leisure environment"" and anxiety level. We also found highly significant positive correlations between the sociometric parameter ""popularity in working environment"" and interpersonal communications, and facial expressions; and between the sociometric parameter ""popularity in leisure environment "" and interpersonal communications, and facial expressions. As a whole, the findings show high importance of ethological investigations with video monitoring for assessment of group behavior in extreme environment. At the same time, correct interpretation of the video recording results requires their comparison with the results of classical socio-psychological methods. We discuss about the different approaches: objective vs. subjective; active vs. discursive; exhaustive vs. restrictive; descriptive vs. introspective.",17,2015-01-01,Article,European Space Agency

These energetic particles have an especially strong effect during extravehicular activity or (in the future) during residence on the surface of Mars, when they spend an extended time there. Such particles reach the orbits of the Earth and of Mars with a delay of several hours relative to solar X-rays and UV radiation. Therefore, there is always time to predict their appearance, in particular, by means of an X-ray-UV radiometer from the apparatus complex of the Space Solar Patrol (SSP) that is being developed by the co-authors of this paper. The paper discusses the far unexplored biophysical problem of manned flight to Mars, scheduled for the next decade. In long-term manned space flights on the orbital stations ""Salyut"" Soviet cosmonaut crews from three of the co-authors (cosmonauts V.V. Kovalenok, A.S. Ivanchenkov, and V.P. Savinykh) had repeatedly observed the effect of certain geophysical conditions on the psychological state of each crew. These effects coincide with the increased intensity of global illumination in the upper ionosphere space on flight altitudes (300-360 km). It is important that during all of these periods, most of the geomagnetic pulsations were completely absent. Possible ways to study the synergistic effects of the simultaneous absence of the geomagnetic field, the magnetic pulsations and the microwave radiation of the terrestrial ionosphere are considered for a flight to Mars.",17,2015-01-01,Article,NA

Therefore the idea of prenosological (pre-medical) diagnosis and the concept of adaptive risks develop in space medicine last years. These new space technologies are being actively tested in terrestrial studies in systems as ""home medicine"". The report presents three variants of systems, respectively, designed to work with a) home PC (""Ecosan-2007"" and ""Ecosan-TM"" complexes), b) Internet connections (""Delta 2013"" device), c) mobile communication channels (""Traffic Lights of Health"" system). The main method of functional conditions evaluation in all these systems is the heart rate variability (HRV) analysis. HRV indices allow us to construct a mathematical model and to compute the stress degree of regulatory systems, their functional reserve and adaptive risk. Hard-software complex ""Ecosan-2007"" was used for monthly monitoring the health status of 120 volunteers in different regions of the world during the longitude medical-environmental research in ""Mars-500"" project. We have obtained the extensive experimental data on the annual and seasonal dynamics of functional states. The instrument «Heart Wizard Mars500» has been also used in this project which enabled, using an ear photopletismographic sensor and Internet, to receive the data of examinations and recommendations at home. These two types of devices became the basis for creation of new appliances - ""Ecosan-TM"" and ""Delta 2013"".

84938061370,The impact of radiation on human health during spaceflight beyond low Earth Orbit,Freese S.,NA,"Proceedings of the International Astronautical Congress, IAC",1,NA,191-198,NA,"Since the beginning of human space exploration, many features of the novel space environment have caused physical ailments to the human explorers. Some of these issues are truly unique to living in space. For example, the long-term health effects of living and working in a microgravity environment can be experienced nowhere else than in an orbiting spacecraft. Other issues, such as radiation exposure, are of significant concern in space but are also present in certain terrestrial environments. Despite some of the similarities with terrestrial radiation, space radiation is rarely encountered in a typical Earth environment. In fact, there are only a few locations in the world where space radiation can even be produced for research purposes (e.g. radiobiology). Although many long-term studies on the health effects of terrestrial radiation have been performed, such as those following the survivors of Hiroshima and Nagasaki, there remain significant uncertainties as to whether or not Earth-based radiation can even be used as a model for space-based radiation. Some of this uncertainty rests with the limited human-applicable radiation data acquired in space environments beyond Low Earth Orbit. Recent publications documenting radiation measurements from NASA's Mars Science Laboratory (MSL) have significantly added to the understanding of expected total radiation exposure doses during a human Mars mission. Despite the uncertainties regarding total space mission radiation doses and the use of Earth-based radiation as a model, it is known that there are unquestionable health risks associated with long-term exposure to space radiation. This paper will discuss those risks, the differences between terrestrial and space radiation, recent knowledge developments regarding space radiation, and also potential countermeasures for protecting future human spaceflight explorers.",0,2014-01-01,Conference Paper,NA
84938060166,Galactic cosmic radiation risk in human space missions,Kasaboski D.,NA,"Proceedings of the International Astronautical Congress, IAC",1,NA,151-164,NA,"Since 1973, no human has traveled beyond low-Earth orbit (LEO). While the exploration of space began as a ""giant leap"" forward, it has subsequently taken a step back, whereby humans have not ventured past LEO in four decades. Recently, there have been a growing number of initiatives to return to the Moon, visit asteroids, and even to go to Mars. Among the many challenges facing such missions, ionizing radiation exposure is one of the least understood and possibly the most dangerous. Despite technological improvements, ionizing radiation exposure continues to threaten the safety and success of human space missions beyond LEO. Galactic cosmic radiation (GCR) is particularly challenging and is reviewed in this report. The characteristics and measurements of GCR are collated from numerous reports providing a collected understanding of GCR prevalence in LEO, interplanetary space, on the Moon, and on Mars. Next, the biological effects of GCR are analysed for various space environments and mission durations. Finally, the effectiveness of shielding is discussed with respect to traditional and alternative designs. The results are not encouraging for human space exploration. Beyond the protection of Earth's atmosphere and geomagnetic field, GCR exposure threatens to exceed NASA's annual (50 cSv) and career radiation limits (100 cSv) imposed on astronauts. There remain many uncertainties concerning the biological effects due to exposure to GCR, resulting in a variety of estimates and models. These models are analysed and presented demonstrating the range of GCR exposure effects. Traditional shielding is shown to be rather ineffective at hindering GCR. Various materials and designs are analysed leading to the conclusion that only high density materials, specifically high hydrogen-density materials, may reduce astronaut exposure to acceptable limits. Additionally, these high-mass solutions would pose considerable engineering challenges to mission designers. Alternative designs, such as active radiation shielding and the use of lunar and Martian regolith are also reviewed. While some reports support the use of regolith, others suggest it is ineffective as a radiation shield. Active radiation shielding is a developing field with many engineering challenges. However, shielding effectiveness models suggest that active radiation shielding may prove not only viable but necessary for the design and success of human space exploration missions.",0,2014-01-01,Conference Paper,NA

The highly abnormal solar activity between cycles 23 and 24 has caused the longest solar minimum in over 80 years and continues into the unusually small solar maximum of cycle 24. As a result of the remarkably weak solar activity, we have also observed the highest fluxes of galactic cosmic rays in the space age and relatively small solar energetic particle events. We use observations from the Cosmic Ray Telescope for the Effects of Radiation (CRaTER) on the Lunar Reconnaissance Orbiter to examine the implications of these highly unusual solar conditions for human space exploration. We show that while these conditions are not a show stopper for long-duration missions (e.g., to the Moon, an asteroid, or Mars), galactic cosmic ray radiation remains a significant and worsening factor that limits mission durations. While solar energetic particle events in cycle 24 present some hazard, the accumulated doses for astronauts behind 10 g/cm2 shielding are well below current dose limits. Galactic cosmic radiation presents a more significant challenge: the time to 3% risk of exposure-induced death (REID) in interplanetary space was less than 400 days for a 30 year old male and less than 300 days for a 30 year old female in the last cycle 23-24 minimum. The time to 3% REID is estimated to be ∼20% lower in the coming cycle 24-25 minimum. If the heliospheric magnetic field continues to weaken over time, as is likely, then allowable mission durations will decrease correspondingly. Thus, we estimate exposures in extreme solar minimum conditions and the corresponding effects on allowable durations.",36,2014-01-01,Article,National Science Foundation

Mars surface habitation is considered a dangerous solution. Among others, radiation, micrometeorites and dust storms, are the major causes of risk for the human well-being during the mission. Caves on Mars can provide a natural shelter against these environmental hazards. Several practical applications address forward the use of caves as habitation opportunity. Within the caves, inflatable structures can be used, as opposed to the heavy structure surface buildings. For this reason, studies were taken to assess the possible areas for which caves could be used as human habitats as an alternative for an initial settlement of Mars. The results obtained not only suggest strong arguments for the use of caves, but also open questions for further quantification and understanding of current unknowns. In the present review,we focus on the hypothetical biological effects due to the cave shelter for natural background radiation that is of three orders of magnitude lower than Mars surface. Background radiation is the ubiquitous ionizing radiation that organisms experienced on the Earth, being present at the appearance of life on Earth. Nevertheless, both the effects of natural background radiation and its absence are not well known. We review the literature based on the effects of the absence of natural background to pursue a common scientific effort to gain scientific knowledge in this future deep space exploration scenario in a Sino-Italy cooperation, taking advantage of the JingPing cavern laboratory in the Sichuan region. © Accademia Nazionale dei Lincei 2013.",2,2014-01-01,Article,NA

To determine whether upright lower body positive pressure (LBPP) provides a suitable space mission simulation, we investigated the cardiovascular responses of normovolemic and hypovolemic men and women to supine and orthostatic stress induced by head-up tilt (HUT) and upright LBPP, representing standing in lunar, Martian, and Earth gravities. Methods: Six men and six women were tested in normovolemic and hypovolemic (furosemide, intravenous, 0.5 mg z kg 2 1 ) conditions. Continuous electrocardiogram, blood pressure, segmental bioimpedance, and stroke volume (echocardiography) were recorded supine and at lunar, Martian, and Earth gravities (10°, 20°, and 80° HUT vs. 20%, 40%, and 100% bodyweight upright LBPP), respectively. Cardiovascular responses were assessed from mean values, spectral powers, and spontaneous barorefl ex parameters. Results: Hypovolemia reduced plasma volume by ; 10% and stroke volume by ; 25% at supine, and increasing orthostatic stress resulted in further reductions. Upright LBPP induced more plasma volume losses at simulated lunar and Martian gravities compared with HUT, while both techniques induced comparable central hypovolemia at each stress. Cardiovascular responses to orthostatic stress were comparable between HUT and upright LBPP in both normovolemic and hypovolemic conditions; however, hypovolemic blood pressure was greater during standing at 100% bodyweight compared to 80° HUT due to a greater increase of total peripheral resistance. Conclusions: The comparable cardiovascular response to HUT and upright LBPP support the use of upright LBPP as a potential model to simulate activity in lunar and Martian gravities. © by the Aerospace Medical Association, Alexandria, VA.",4,2014-01-01,Article,National Center for Advancing Translational Sciences

A team of engineers at the Jet Propulsion Laboratory (JPL), California Institute of Technology have developed an atmospheric sample collection canister for Martian application. The engineering strategy has two basic elements: first, to collect two separately sealed 50 cubic centimeter unpressurized atmospheric samples with minimal sensing and actuation in a self contained pressure vessel; and second, to package this atmospheric sample canister in such a way that it can be easily integrated into the orbiting sample capsule for collection and return to Earth. Sample collection and integrity are demonstrated by emulating the atmospheric collection portion of the Mars Sample Return mission on a compressed timeline. The test results achieved by varying the pressure inside of a thermal vacuum chamber while opening and closing the valve on the sample canister at Mars ambient pressure. A commercial off-the-shelf medical grade micro-valve is utilized in the first iteration of this design to enable rapid testing of the system. The valve has been independently leak tested at JPL to quantify and separate the leak rates associated with the canister. The results are factored in to an overall system design that quantifies mass, power, and sensing requirements for a Martian atmospheric Sample Collection (MASC) canister as outlined in the Mars Sample Return mission profile.

X-ray diffraction from a synchrotron radiation source (SOLEIL) was used to identify and follow the evolution of second-phase particles that are in very small volume fractions in two zirconium alloys: Zy-4 in stress-relieved metallurgical state before irradiation and Zr-1%Nb (M5®) in recrystallized metallurgical state before and after neutron irradiation. Despite the fact the neutron irradiated sample is not in the as-irradiated state due to a thermal treatment and creep test performed after irradiation, interesting results have been obtained on secondary phases using XRD techniques. Analyses have been performed at the MARS beamline, fully dedicated to advanced structural and chemical characterizations of radioactive matter. A first proof of the improvement brought by these new analyses performed at the MARS beamline is given with Zr(Fe, Cr)2 precipitates found in unirradiated Zy-4 alloy in stress relieved metallurgical state, highly textured and displaying significant residual stresses and numerous dislocations: lattice parameters, crystallite size and microstrains (line profile analysis using the Williamson-Hall method after correction for instrumental broadening) have been estimated with very good accuracy. Then, second phase particles of the Zr-1%Nb alloy (M5®) have been analyzed before and after irradiation. For the Zr(Fe, Nb)2 Laves phase, the diffraction line disappeared after neutron irradiation. For β-Nb phases, the evolution of diffraction peaks clearly show the convolution of two phenomena: in one hand slight decreases in Nb content for native β-Nb particles and on the other hand irradiation-enhanced precipitation of nano-sized needle-like β-Nb particles. To our knowledge, this is the first time that the crystallographic unit cell, lattice parameter and Nb content of the β-Nb irradiation-enhanced precipitates have been determined using synchrotron radiation on irradiated Zr-1%Nb (M5®) alloy. © 2013 Elsevier B.V.

This environment mainly consists of two parts: Galactic Cosmic Rays (GCRs) propagating through the Martian atmosphere to the surface, and secondary particles created by interactions of the primary GCRs and the Martian atmosphere and soil. RAD also successfully measured the radiation environment in the spacecraft on MSL’s cruise to Mars. There, the radiation environment was dominated by GCRs, but interactions with the surrounding material of the spacecraft created a non-negligible contribution of secondary particles. Also, five Solar Energetic Particle events were observed during cruise. RAD is designed to distinguish between neutral and charged particles. Charged particles are further distinguished between those that stop in the detectors and those that penetrate. In this presentation, we will give an overview of the RAD instrument and present results of charged particle measurements during the cruise phase.",0,2013-01-01,Conference Paper,National Aeronautics and Space Administration

It is of little value, for example, to discuss psychological issues as if they existed independently of engineering, sociological, physiological, and even political and economic issues. Simply put, there is no sense in discussing flights to the outer planets to be conducted at this time because it is not psychologically or physiologically possible. As an example, recently the Jet Propulsion Laboratory (JPL), in conjunction with the European Space Agency (ESA), sent the Cassini/Huygens probe to the planet Saturn and its moon, Titan. Given the resources available at the present time, that journey took 7 years. That would mean a 14-year round trip for a human space crew with no time at the destination. This is not physiologically possible, and it would be psychologically absurd. Yet humankind dreams of exploring the entire solar system, planets, moons, asteroids, and comets. Given that all of the disciplines mentioned above overlap in their involvement with human space flight, this chapter examines the promise of near-future long duration spaceflight fromamultidisciplinary point of view. This chapter explores psychology’s contributions to understanding human performance in space, with emphasis on the role of the autonomic nervous system. We consider what data we have about how long explorers in situations of high risk, crowding, lack of privacy, the inability to leave, and sometimes great discomfort, can be away from home, family, and life as we normally know it, and recover to live normal lives. After finding evidence to support a psychological benchmark duration, the chapter examines technology now in serious development that would make such a flight possible, using trips to Mars and Saturn as examples. But even meeting the psychological benchmark does not address the physiological debilitation of such an extended period of weightlessness. The chapter thus examines a potential physiological “deal breaker,” bone demineralization, as well as current active research that suggests that this critical problem is in the process of being understood and solved. After proposing two promising solutions for bone demineralization, the chapter suggests that near-term spaceflight to the outer planets is reasonable to expect. The chapter closes by considering the advantages of returning to the Moon as a step toward exploratory missions to Mars, as well as the value of including humans in future missions to asteroids.",0,2013-01-01,Chapter,NA

The Strategic Knowledge Gaps will be addressed through a portfolio of activities that are jointly planned and funded by NASA's exploration and science organizations. The initial Joint Robotic Precursor Activities (JRPA) include development of a lunar resources prospecting payload in partnership with the Canadian Space Agency; development of a small lander and flight tests of an autonomous precision landing system; imaging near-Earth asteroids with ground-based radar; and a radiation detector on the Mars Science Laboratory rover to measure the interplanetary and surface radiation environments.

Since future spacecrafts designs and shapes are evolving continuous assessments of shielding and radiation risks are needed to optimize such designs for radiation protection. In this study, we present a predictive software capability that calculates risks to humans inside a spacecraft prototype and locates weak points in the spacecraft's radiation shielding. The software uses CAD software, Pro/Engineer, and the Space Radiation Program's Fishbowl tool kit to quantify radiation shielding provided by the spacecraft geometry by calculating the areal density seen at a certain point, dose point, inside the spacecraft. Shielding results are assessed using the NASA-developed software, HZETRN, BRYNTRN, and QMSFRG to quantify particle spectra at sensitive organs in a human body located in the vehicle exposed to GCR or SPEs. Organ doses are used to quantify risks on astronauts' health and life using the NASA Space Cancer Risk (NSCR) code. The software locates shielding weak points-hotspots-and visually shows them on the spacecraft's outer surface by creating a red mark on the surface where the shielding is below a safety threshold set by designers. A color coding capability of the software allows the outer surface to have different colors based on the shielding provided to a single dose point inside the spacecraft. This study presents a future Martian Transport Vehicle prototype design and shows the iterative process of optimizing the mass distribution based on feedback from the predictive software capabilities. The impact of design optimization on point dose and effective dose for August 1972 SPE shows a dose reduction of 7 and 3 folds respectively. © 2012 by the American Institute of Aeronautics and Astronautics, Inc.",0,2012-12-01,Conference Paper,NA

The MLTVs and MCTV are assembled in low Earth orbit (LEO) from modules launched by four Space Launch System (SLS) and five Delta IV Heavy rockets. The MLTVs and MCTV individually escape from LEO, transit to Mars, brake into Mars orbit using propulsion and aerobraking, and rendezvous and dock in low Mars orbit (LMO). Each MLTV includes an Earth Departure stage (EDS), Mars Transfer Stage (MTS), Lander Service Module (LSM), and two landers: A Mars Personnel Lander (MPL) provides two-way crew transportation between LMO and the surface. Three unmanned Mars Cargo Landers (MCLs) provide one-way cargo transportation and the functionalities of habitats (MCL-H) (2) and rover (MCL-R). The landers rendezvous and assemble on the surface to form a base. The MCTV includes two EDS, two MTS, and the following: (1) The Multi-Purpose Crew Vehicle (MPCV) transports the crew from Earth to LEO, provides propulsion, and returns the crew to Earth after nominal mission completion or in aborts. (2) Three Deep Space Vehicles (DSVs) provide life support consumables, passive biological radiation shielding, crew habitation space, and propulsion. The DSV design was derived from the MCL-H. (3) An Artificial Gravity Module (AGM) allows the MCTV to rotate and generate artificial gravity for the crew and provides photo-voltaic power generation and deep space communications. A miniature magnetosphere (Mini-Mag), a potential key enabler for human interplanetary exploration, is electromagnetically generated on the AGM and provides active crew biological radiation shielding.

These risks arise from a number of sources, including solar particle events (SPEs), galactic cosmic rays (GCRs), secondary radiation from surface impacts, and even the nuclear isotope power sources transported with the astronauts. The serious early and late radiation health effects potentially posed by these exposures are equally varied, ranging from early signs of radiation sickness to cancer induction. Other possible effects include central nervous system damage, cataracts, cardiovascular damage, heritable effects, impaired wound healing, and infertility. Recent research, much of which has been sponsored by NASA, has focused on understanding and quantifying the radiation health risks posed by space radiation environments. Although many aspects of the space radiation environments are now relatively well characterized, important uncertainties still exist regarding biological effects and thus regarding the level and types of risks faced by astronauts. This report presents an evaluation of NASA's proposed space radiation cancer risk assessment model, which is described in the 2011 NASA report, Space Radiation Cancer Risk Projections and Uncertainties--2010. The evaluation in Technical Evaluation of the NASA Model for Cancer Risk to Astronauts Due to Space Radiation considers the model components, input data (for the radiation types, estimated doses, and epidemiology), and the associated uncertainties.

We sent frozen human lymphoblastoid TK6 cells to the International Space Station where they were maintained under frozen conditions during a 134-day mission (14 November 2008 to 28 March 2009) except for an incubation period of 8 days under 1G or μG conditions in a CO 2 incubator. The incubation period started after 100 days during which the cells had been exposed to 54 mSv of space radiation. The incubated cells were then refrozen, returned to Earth, and compared to ground control samples for the determination of the influence of microgravity on cell survival and mutation induction. The results for both varied from experiment to experiment, yielding a large SD, but the μG sample results differed significantly from the 1G sample results for each of 2 experiments, with the mean ratio of μG to 1G being 0.55 for the concentration of viable cells and 0.59 for the fraction of thymidine kinase deficient (TK - ) mutants. Among the mutants, non-loss of zygosity events (point mutations) were less frequent (31%) after μG incubation than after 1G incubation, which might be explained by the influence of μG on cellular metabolic or physiological function.

Since it is not possible to measure the radiation environment inside of human organs in deep space, simulations based on radiation transport/interaction codes coupled to phantoms of tissue equivalent materials are used. However, the calculated results depend on the models used in the codes, and it is therefore necessary to verify their validity by comparison with measured data. The goal of this paper is to compare absorbed doses obtained in the MATROSHKA-R experiment performed at the International Space Station (ISS) with simulations performed with the three-dimensional Monte Carlo Particle and Heavy-Ion Transport code System (PHITS). The absorbed dose was measured using passive detectors (packages of thermoluminescent and plastic nuclear track detectors) placed on the surface of the spherical tissue equivalent phantom MATROSHKA-R, which was exposed aboard the ISS in the Service Zvezda Module from December 2005 to September 2006. The data calculated by PHITS assuming an ISS shielding of 3 g/cm 2 and 5 g/cm 2 aluminum mass thickness were in good agreement with the measurements. Using a simplified geometrical model of the ISS, the influence of variations in altitude and wall mass thickness of the ISS on the calculated absorbed dose was estimated. The uncertainties of the calculated data are also discussed; the relative expanded uncertainty of absorbed dose in phantom was estimated to be 44% at a 95% confidence level. © 2011 COSPAR.

The RAD instrument operations concept is intended to reduce impact to spacecraft resources and effort for the MSL operations team. By design, RAD autonomously performs regular science observations without the need for frequent commanding from the Rover Compute Element (RCE). RAD operates with pre-defined ""sleep"" and ""observe"" periods, with an adjustable duty cycle for meeting power and data volume constraints during the mission. At the start of a new science observation, RAD performs a preobservation activity to assess count rates for selected RAD detector elements. Based on this assessment, RAD can enter ""solar event"" mode, in which instrument parameters (including observation duration) are selected to more effectively characterize the environment. At the end of each observation period, RAD stores a time-tagged, fixed length science data packet in its non-volatile mass memory storage. The operating cadence is defined by adjustable parameters, also stored in non-volatile memory within the instrument. Periodically, the RCE executes an on-board sequence to transfer RAD science data packets from the instrument mass storage to the MSL downlink buffer. Infrequently, the RAD instrument operating configuration is modified by updating internal parameter tables and configuration entries. RAD cruise operations were conducted at JPL through the MSL Mission Operations Team. RAD activities were fully reviewed and approved according to procedures consistent with a NASA flagship mission. No formal mission requirements were in place for conducting a long-term science investigation with instruments in cruise. Yet the RAD instrument characterized the radiation environment inside an interplanetary spacecraft for over seven months in transit to Mars.

In the last 35 days of isolation, in order to simulate autonomous flight conditions, some serious restrictions were established for the crew resupply and communication with Mission Control (MC). The objective of the study was to investigate psychophysiological and behavioral aspects (communication) of adaptation during this period of high autonomy. We used computerized analysis of the crew written daily reports to calculate the frequencies of utilization of certain semantic units, expressing different psychological functions. To estimate the level of psycho-physiological stress, we measured the concentration of urinal cortisol once in two weeks. To investigate psycho-emotional state, we used the questionnaire SAN, estimating Mood, Activity and Health once in two weeks. During the simulation of autonomous flight, we found out the different tendencies of communicative behavior. One group of subjects demonstrated the tendency to activation and self-government under high autonomy conditions. The other subjects continued to use communicative strategy that we called closing the communication channel. Active communication strategy was accompanied by increasing in subjective scores of mood and activity. The subjects, whose communication strategy was attributed as closing, demonstrated the considerably lower subjective scores of mood and activity.

Often, this hazard is not adequately addressed in the conceptual phase of architecture modeling and evaluation. This situation can lead to candidate designs that inadequately mitigate crew needs related to radiation protection and can result in under prediction of critical metrics such as mass, cost, and safety. In this paper, the current standard for radiation exposure in human spaceflight to Mars is reviewed, and a method for estimating crew radiation dose during the conceptual design phase is presented. This method is useful during low fidelity modeling activities that do not explicitly consider habitat design and interior layout are not explicitly considered. From that estimate, radiation shielding can be specified to bring crew exposure below the necessary limits. The method is demonstrated for a crewed mission to Mars and compared to existing plans that are not constrained by the crew radiation exposure limit. This is used to highlight the mass and cost shortcomings that can arise when the radiation requirement is ignored when a baseline is established. © 2011 by Andrew Maxwell, Alan Wilhite, Robert Singleterry.",0,2011-12-01,Conference Paper,NA

The full 520-day Mars mission simulation with an international crew of 3 Russians, 1 Chinese, 2 Europeans (French, Italian) from ESA and implemented in a space simulation facility at IBMP started in June 2010 and foresees the simulation of a 245-day journey to Mars, 30 days of ""Mars surface activities"" with 3 EVAs and a 245-day return transfer to Earth. The crew is faced with an environment and constraints as close to a realistic Mars mission as possible, such as limited volume and privacy, no real-time interactive communication with mission control, limited resources and the need for full crew autonomy. At the same time they perform an extensive science programme covering a wide range of scientific and technological topics. One of the pre-conditions for successful human exploration missions is the maintenance of physical and mental crew health. Some of the main psychological challenges in such a mission scenario are physical, communicative and emotional isolation from the outside world, sensory deprivation and limited social contacts, cultural differences and potential incompatibilities of crew members from different countries, permanent awareness about the need for full crew autonomy also in emergency situations and continuous exposure to a hazardous environment. The maintenance of mental crew health can only be achieved through a comprehensive psychological support programme consisting of measures to efficiently counteract the negative effects of the constraining mission environment. The Mars-500 project does not only serve as an excellent platform for scientists implementing a research programme but it also provides the opportunity to elaborate and test new long-duration human mission operations concepts and procedures in practice which differ from the established approach presently implemented for ISS, specifically in the area of psychological crew support. This paper will provide an overview of the constraints potentially impacting psychological crew health in future interplanetary missions in general and the Mars-500 mission in particular. It will also describe the psychological support programme implemented during the Mars-500 mission and it will show some of the preliminary results in terms of efficiency of the psychological countermeasures.",0,2011-12-01,Conference Paper,NA

Neutral particles are an important contribution to this radiation environment. RAD measures them with a CsI (Tl) and a plastic scintillator, which are both surrounded by an anticoincidence. The incident neutron/gamma spectrum is obtained from the measurements using inversion methods which often fit a functional behavior, e.g., a power law, to the measured data applying the instrument response function and, e.g., a least-squares method. In situations where count rates are small, i.e., where the stochastic nature of the measurement is evident, maximum likelihood estimates with underlying Poissonian statistics improve the resulting spectra. We demonstrate the measurement and inversion of gamma/neutron spectra for a detector concept featuring one high-density scintillator and one high-proton-content scintillator. The applied inversion methods derive the original spectra without any strong assumptions of the functional behavior. Instrument response functions are obtained from Monte-Carlo simulations in matrix form with which the instrument response is treated as a set of linear equations. Using the response matrices we compare a constrained least-squares minimization, a chi-squared minimization and a maximum likelihood method with underlying Poissonian statistics. We make no assumptions about the incident particle spectrum and the methods intrinsically satisfy the constraint of non-negative counts. We analyzed neutron beam measurements made at the Physikalisch Technische Bundesanstalt (PTB) and inverted the measurement data for both neutron and gamma spectra. Monte-Carlo-generated measurements of the expected Martian neutron/gamma spectra were inverted as well, here the maximum likelihood method with underlying Poissonian statistics produces significantly better results. © 2011 Elsevier B.V.

The strategy of using modular robotics of architectural space-making demonstrates an architecture whereby adaptation becomes much more holistic and operates at a very small scale. The strategy of using self replicating strategies as a catalyst for autonomous architectural construction was very much driven by the premise of an advanced architectural design studio. This paper highlights conceptual contributions by architecture students for alternative means of Martian Colonization through means creating architecture that creates itself. The parameters of the design project had three primary considerations including: The actual trajectory issues (how to get materials to the Mars), Chemical Processing (how to make materials on the Mars) and Space Manufacturing (how to fabricate and assemble/construct things on Mars). Of these central issues explored in this studio, the focus was primarily on Manufacturing as a process carried out by small modular robotics. The premise of the approach is that rather than sending a constructed architecture to space, we send tiny robotic modules that are capable of mobility and reproduction through automated fabrication techniques using in-situ materials. The modules with embedded sensors, self-healing composites, and responsive materials were designed to construct buildings aimed at adaptation. Such buildings could potentially respond in a humanlike way to counteract loads, reduce material and allow for active environmental adaptation. When enough of architecture of the colony has constructed itself - we send humans to inhabit it.Several examples by architecture students are highlighted whereby individual modules were created within the context of a space architecture design studio and applied to scenarios of space making at various scales. The design context primarily focused on the master plan of a colony for 10,000 inhabitants. The colony is an assembly of numerous discrete yet interconnected projects that include residential, public, civil, industrial, commercial, research, healthcare, and farming etc. The environment on mars was also seriously considered including: gravity, pressure, radiation, and the mass balance of resources and waste required for sustaining human life at such a scale. Students worked in teams of two to produce complete colony designs including the detailed development and a construction/ fabrication concept for one of the buildings. Students developed scaled prototypes of the system that successfully demonstrated the robotic aspects of their project. Physical models demonstrated actual robotics, structure and materials. Biomimetic strategies were employed as a means to satisfy adaptability in terms of form, processes, and systems. Central to biomimicry within the context of the work was an understanding of the process by which organisms grow and develop including includes growth, differentiation, and morphogenesis. In terms of adaptation, the area of morphogenesis was primarily studied as a means to create an architecture that ensures a continuous turnover of cellular-like robotic modules that dynamically ensure mechanical integrity similar to that of a living, evolving system. The projects successfully demonstrate various strategies for mechanical design, locomotion and control. © 2011 Springer-Verlag.",0,2011-07-19,Conference Paper,NA

The organ doses and effective doses are tabulated for carbon dioxide atmospheric shielding areal densities ranging from 0 to 300 g cm-2 followed by aluminum spacecraft or habitat shield areal densities ranging from 0 to 100 g cm-2.

These models, being based on conventional biological theories, are implemented as the systems of nonlinear differential equations whose variables and constant parameters have clear biological meaning. Thorough analytical and numerical analysis of the proposed models is performed. It is found that the models on hand are capable of reproducing the dynamical regimes which are typical for the thrombocytopoiesis and granulocytopoiesis in the norm and in the case of hematological disorders, such as cyclic thrombocytopenia and cyclic neutropenia. The elaborated models are applied to investigate the dynamics of thrombocytopoiesis and granulocytopoiesis in astronauts exposed to space radiation during long-term missions such as voyages to Mars. The dose rate equivalent for space radiation (galactic cosmic rays (GCR) and solar particles event (SPE)) is taken as a variable parameter of the models. It is revealed that the thrombocytopoietic and granulocytopoietic systems can adapt themselves to GCR exposure. It is also shown that an SPE causes damped oscillations of the ""effective"" radiosensitivity of these cell systems that, in turn, determines the strength of their responses to the subsequent SPE. Specifically, depending on the time interval between SPEs, the preceding SPE can induce either radiosensitization or radioprotection effects on the thrombocytopoietic and granulocytopoietic systems. In the last case, adaptive responses to the subsequent SPE in these systems occur. All this testifies to the efficiency of employment of the developed models in investigation and prediction of effects of space radiation on the thrombocytopoietic and granulocytopoietic systems. The developed models of these vital body systems provide a better understanding of the risks to health from the solar particles events and enable one to evaluate the need of operational applications of countermeasures for astronauts in the long-term space missions. © 2011 COSPAR.

The objective of this study was to develop methods for evaluating the effects of simulated Mars environmental conditions on the transmissivity and mechanical strength of candidate greenhouse cladding materials. The University of Florida's Mars Simulation Chamber was utilized to expose material samples to simulated Mars environmental conditions. Changes in control versus exposed material sample transmissivities were measured using a spectroradiometer over a range of wavelengths from 200 to 800 nm and material peak yield stresses were determined using an Instron universal testing machine. Results indicated that, under Mars simulated environmental conditions for 42 Mars equivalent days, materials experienced a reduction in transmission in the photosynthetically active region and a decrease in material strength.

Space radiation consists of solar particle events (SPEs), comprised largely of medium energy protons (less than several hundred MeV); and galactic cosmic rays (GCR), which include high-energy protons and heavy ions. While the frequency distribution of SPEs depends strongly upon the phase within the solar activity cycle, the individual SPE occurrences themselves are random in nature. A solar modulation model has been developed for the temporal characterization of the GCR environment, which is represented by the deceleration potential, φ. The risk of radiation exposure to astronauts as well as to hardware from SPEs during extra-vehicular activities (EVAs) or in lightly shielded vehicles is a major concern for radiation protection. To support the probabilistic risk assessment for EVAs, which could be up to 15% of crew time2 on lunar missions, we estimated the probability of SPE occurrence as a function of solar cycle phase using a non-homogeneous Poisson model [1] to fit the historical database of measurements of protons with energy>30 MeV, Φ30. The resultant organ doses and dose equivalents, as well as effective whole body doses, for acute and cancer risk estimations are analyzed for a conceptual habitat module and for a lunar rover during space missions of defined durations.

In order to estimate these hazards, it is essential to quantify the gradients of SEP intensities in the IP medium. The Earth-Moon-Mars Radiation Exposure Module (EMMREM) is a new project aimed at characterizing the time-dependent radiation exposure in IP space. In this paper, we utilize EMMREM to study the radial dependence of proton peak intensities, event fluences, and radiation dose equivalents of 27-31 May 2003 SEP events at eight different locations between 1 and 4.91 AU at energies between ∼1.5 MeV and ∼130 MeV. We have modeled onset times and intensity profiles of the SEP events at Mars and Ulysses and found very good agreement at different energies. We report observations of energetic particles at locations with magnetic field line footprints that are separated by ∼90 in heliolongitude, possibly indicating very large coronal mass ejection sizes and/or high cross-field diffusion at large radial distances. Our results show that radial dependencies of proton peak intensities exhibit a broken power law between 1 to 2.5 AU and 2.5 to 4.91 AU, ranging between R -2.52 ± 0.42 and R-5.97 ± 0.32 for 25 MeV and between R-2.13 ± 0.36 and R-5.21 ± 0.29 for 52 MeV, where R is the radial distance from the Sun in units of AU.

Radiation protection encompasses all mission aspects starting with mission architecture and planning, mitigation strategies through the integration of appropriate shielding within all the mission elements, and overall detailed operational procedures are as well critical to ensure the highest probability for a manned mission to become an operational reality as well a success. Once surface outpost structures such as habitats and rovers have been designed to integrate radiation protection materials, then detailed operational procedures must be developed to ensure the ALARA philosophy in order as well to minimize the risk of impact from exposure to SPEs and to keep overall mission doses at an operational minimum. All these concepts are intrinsically dependent upon the surface outpost design and construction elements and must be developed and must be thoroughly tested beforehand in order to accomplish minimal exposure to space weather of the crew members. This will in turn aim to avoid the occurrence of worse case scenarios such as Loss of Crew (LOC) and loss of mission (LOM) if severe radiation events such as solar storms of the August 1972 type are not avoided in time. On the surface, in particular, radiation protection of the lunar base is achieved mostly through the proper management of the shielding within the habitats. The surface infrastructure, therefore, plays a significant role in controlling the total overall mission dose, especially when considering a long term human mission as the one in this project.

Space is clearly a hostile environment for human being bodies. Exposure to cosmic radiation is one risk that could and should be reduced while applying constructive measures. In order to mitigate the possible hazards of space environment on humans, a mandatory step shall be the knowledge and characterization of the space radiation. Different research activities are already going into the direction of understanding the interaction-between and the effect-of space environment on human body. What is still ""incomplete"" is the accurate determination of radiation dose in space. This paper draws a mission concept allowing measuring on both large scale temporal and spatial surface radiation and temperature on a planetary body. Mars and Moon surfaces are assumed as reference scenarios. A distributed instrument consisting of spreading around both on Martian and Lunar surfaces a certain number of ""hypothetical"" radiation sensors is considered. Those small sensors relay on the capability of communicating among themselves in a wireless networked fashion. The problem is seen from the perspective of how it would be possible to deploy, distribute from orbit and land on the surface the mentioned sensors down to a representative area and communicate to Earth, directly or via a relay spacecraft, the collected data. Due to the inherent difference of assumed scenarios (Mars and Moon) different strategies to build the distributed web-based instrument are analyzed.

The Martian Radiation Environment Experiment (MARIE) was a dedicated energetic charged particle spectrometer, but it ceased functioning during the large solar storm of October/November 2003. Data from two other Odyssey instruments are used here: the Gamma Ray Spectrometer and the scintillator component of the High Energy Neutron Detector. Though not primarily designed to measure energetic charged particles, both systems are sensitive to them, and several years of data are available from both. Using the MARIE data for calibration of the other systems, count rates can be normalized (with significant uncertainties) to absolute fluxes of both GCR and solar energetic particles (SEP). The data, which cover the time span from early 2002 through the end of 2007, clearly show the solar cycle-dependent modulation of the GCR starting in 2004. Many SPEs were recorded as well and are cataloged here. Threshold energies were relatively high, ranging from 16 MeV in the most sensitive channel to 42 MeV. These thresholds are not optimal for detailed studies of SEPs, but this is the range of interest for calculations of dose and dose equivalent, pertinent to human flight, and covering that range was the original motivation for MARIE. The data are available on request and are potentially of use for the Earth-Moon-Mars Radiation Environment Module collaboration and other heliospheric modeling projects.

In fact, in addition to the poor knowledge on the late effects of heavy ions in the cosmic rays, simple countermeasures are apparently not available. Shielding is indeed very problematic in space, because of mass problems and the high-energy of the cosmic rays, and radio-protective drugs or dietary supplements are not effective. However, the simplest countermeasure for reducing radiation risk is to shorten the duration time, particularly the transit time to Mars, where the dose rate is higher than on the planet surface. Here we show that using nuclear electric propulsion (NEP) rockets, the transit time could be substantially reduced to a point where radiation risk could be considered acceptable even with the current uncertainty on late effects. © 2010 EDP Sciences, SIF, Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.",10,2010-10-01,Article,NA

To significantly reduce the cost associated with transportation of such materials and structures from earth, it is imperative that such building materials should be synthesized primarily from Martian in situ resources. This paper illustrates the feasibility of such an approach. Experimental results are discussed to demonstrate the synthesis of polyethylene (PE) from a simulated Martian atmosphere and the fabrication of a composite material using simulated Martian regolith with PE as the binding material. The radiation shielding effectiveness of the proposed composites is analyzed using results from radiation transport codes and exposure of the samples to high-energy beams that serve as a terrestrial proxy for the GCR environment.

This paper suggests that appropriate additional analogues would be the multi-year maritime and terrestrial explorations that mapped the surface of the Earth in previous centuries. These, like Mars, often involved a hazardous trek through unknown territory, flanked by extended, dangerous voyages to and from the exploration sites. Characteristic issues included interpersonal relationships under prolonged stress, stretches of boredom interspersed with intense work demands, the impossibility of rescue, resupply, or other help from home, chronic danger, physical discomfort and lack of privacy, and the crucial role of the leader.

Radiation shielding will be an enabling feature for exploration architectures that return man to the moon and Mars. A radiation shield that could be attached to different kinds of platforms would ideally serve as a second line of defense for localized protection of astronauts and equipment. It is envisioned that a flexible and lightweight radiation shielding kit would contain elements that could be worn and deployed in various configurations and packed into a manageable volume for flight. LaRC and ILC Dover have undertaken a task to study and develop a flexible radiation shielding kit with state of the art effectiveness in scattering galactic cosmic radiation and solar particle event radiation. Polyethylene, with a high density of hydrogen in its molecular chains, shows the greatest potential for radiation protection. A material ply-up has been developed that provides 1.0 g/cm2 of shielding while maintaining manufacturability and acceptable functionality in terms of stowability, flexibility, and ease of use. Concept generation and system trade studies resulted in selection of vest and blanket architectures that best meet the radiation shield kit requirements developed by LaRC. In addition reconfigurable stowage containers have been developed using a 0.5 - 1.0 g/cm2 ply-up. Prototype components and test sample ply-ups have been fabricated proving the feasibility of flexible, reconfigurable components and providing a key testbed for evaluation and future development.

Planning for psychological health for long duration inhabitation missions rather than short duration task accomplishment profiles is further complicated by the need to address both flight issues as well as station issues. The fundamental problem today in developing effective countermeasures for long duration missions is the fact that space missions are not truly psychologically comparable to any other undertaking humans have ever attempted (e.g., long-duration stays on orbital space stations, historical expeditions to unknown parts of the Earth, wintering-over in Antarctica, long-term submergence in submarines) differing most notably in the enormous distance to travel, the unique separation from the rest of humanity and the extraordinary demands of an environment characterized by the lack of any fundamental environmental factor (e.g., air, water, gravity) heretofore required for survival. Mission scenarios call for crewmembers to endure extraordinary long periods of extreme confinement and isolation compounded with the absence of normal sensory input that would regulate psychological and physiological functioning. Increased known psychological risks related to individual performance, behavioral health and crew interactions will be magnified by completely new unpredictable psychological challenges under these extraordinary conditions of isolation and confinement from the rest of humanity. A broad spectrum of social psychological and behavioral research has contributed to the emerging realization that many of the negative psychological factors of long duration Moon/Mars missions (e.g., prolonged isolation, confinement, exposure to unpredictable and unknown extreme environment, reliance on closed loop environmental system) could be mitigated by designing habitats that thoughtfully countered some of these impacts. The intersection of psychology and psychosocial factors with habitat design allows us to implement psychological support in non-intrusive, holistic environmental modalities that are preventive in orientation rather than palliative. The present paper discusses those psychological factors with mission structure or design implications that can be addressed by a thoughtful and proactive implementation of psychological and psychosocial support systems and countermeasure environmental elements, including enabling technologies on the horizon that would significantly contribute to the successful psychological adaptation of long duration space inhabitants.",1,2010-01-01,Chapter,NA

The studies address astronauts' motor adaptation to microgravity during short-term stays and the crews' social behavior in isolation and confinement over extended time periods. The current working hypotheses are based on differences observed in multicultural and mixed-gender crews for future interplanetary missions. Methods: In our approach, we use The Observer XT® computer application to facilitate the observation, description, and quantification of behavioral data collected in parabolic flights, isolation and confinement campaigns, and polar missions. We implemented video recording protocols based on a goal-directed orientation task and daily life activities. Results: The software integrates several steps: project management, definition of a coding scheme, annotation of videos linked to external data, data selection, and analysis. Numerical outcomes are presented. We show differences in motor skills between male (resting: 22%) and female (flexing/stretching: 22%) subjects in parabolic flights. We did not observe significant differences in social behavior by nationality during the isolation and confinement campaign. Notable findings include cultural grouping (20% of place preferences) and gender-based individuality (15%) during wintering at the polar base. Discussion: The Observer XT ® may be a valuable tool to synchronize behavioral events with video files and bring forth visual representations and statistical analysis.

However, it is unclear if long missions outside of low-Earth orbit can be accomplished with acceptable risk. The central objective of a new modeling project, the Earth-Moon-Mars Radiation Exposure Module (EMMREM), is to develop and validate a numerical module for characterizing time-dependent radiation exposure in the Earth-Moon-Mars and interplanetary space environments. EMMREM is being designed for broad use by researchers to predict radiation exposure by integrating over almost any incident particle distribution from interplanetary space. We detail here the overall structure of the EMMREM module and study the dose histories of the 2003 Halloween storm event and a June 2004 event. We show both the event histories measured at 1 AU and the evolution of these events at observer locations beyond 1 AU. The results are compared to observations at Ulysses. The model allows us to predict how the radiation environment evolves with radial distance from the Sun. The model comparison also suggests areas in which our understanding of the physics of particle propagation and energization needs to be improved to better forecast the radiation environment. Thus, we introduce the suite of EMMREM tools, which will be used to improve risk assessment models so that future human exploration missions can be adequately planned for.

Biomedical research at the Antarctic Concordia Station. What advances does it highlight? Overview of findings in psychology, neuroscience, sleep, cardiovascular physiology and immune system, relevant in isolated, confined and extreme environments and spaceflight. Abstract: Extended stays in isolated, confined and extreme (ICE) environments like Antarctica are associated with a whole set of psychological and physiological challenges for the crew. As such, winter-over stays at Antarctica provide an important opportunity to acquire knowledge into the physiological and psychological changes that ICE environments inevitably bring. The European Space Agency (ESA) is particularly interested in conducting research in such an environment, as it is a unique opportunity to translate these results to space crews experiencing very similar issues. In the past two decades, the ESA has supported a total of 36 biomedical research projects at the Concordia station in collaboration with the French and Italian polar institutes. More specifically, studies in the areas of psychology, neuroscience, sleep physiology, cardiovascular physiology and immunology were performed. The outcomes of these studies are directly relevant for people working in ICE environments, but also help to better understand the biomedical challenges of those environments. Consequently, they can help to better prepare for human space exploration and to identify countermeasures to minimize the adverse effects of space environments on astronaut health. The aim of this review is to provide an overview of the biomedical studies that have taken place in the past two decades at the Antarctic Concordia station and to summarize the results and their implication for human spaceflight.",1,2021-01-01,Article,European Space Agency

A segment of a stage is a period of sleep from the moment of onset of the stage of interest to the moment at which it is replaced by another stage. The analysis included segments of sleep stages noted on the hypnograms of 70 polysomnography traces from the sleep of six healthy people in the experimental conditions of the Mars 500 project. It has been suggested that the appearance of one or another sleep stage may be linked with the duration of the preceding stage. The studies reported here showed that the durations of segments of all sleep stages overall, with the exception of stage 3, were random, where interruption of segments was independent of their preceding duration. Stage 3 had low stability in the fi rst 2.5 min of occurrence, which increased the probability of its termination; when it lasted longer, the process of interruption started to be random. The interstage transitions studied here established that the occurrence of waking or shallow sleep (stage 1) from stage 3 or REM sleep had a high probability after prolonged periods in these states. Other interstage transitions were random. We suggest that increases in the durations of δ-sleep segments and the stage with rapid eye movements could lead to the development of arousal processes. Further analysis of the longest δ-sleep and REM sleep segments may have potential for constructing mathematical models of sleep and studies of arousal processes during sleep and the mechanisms of their impairments.",0,2020-06-01,Article,NA

Spending an extended duration of time in an isolated and confined environment could degrade the cognitive state and performance of the operators within a crew. In the context of Mars exploration or a Lunar base, professional tasks such as teleoperation will be performed, and therefore their outcome might be impacted by the crew's cognitive state. Previous studies have shown evidence of the impact that stressors associated to confinement have on behavioral patterns and sleep quality. This investigation links then the aforementioned stressors to task performance. Hence, in order to investigate whether teleoperation task performance might be impacted by the crew's mental state in a confined and isolated setting, a correlational study was run on data acquired from the Crew 206 of the Mars Desert Research Station (MDRS) in the Utah Desert. The participants were French students (n=5, Mean Age=21, s = 0.707) who underwent a confinement period of 3 weeks. Over these weeks, they performed 7 teleoperation tasks. The task consisted in the guidance of a rover for a sample collection on the lunar surface. Operator performance was measured by recording the completion time and the frequency of errors. The participants' sleep data were measured with the Dreem headband, a portable Electroencephalogram (EEG). Only the sleep data from the night before each session were considered. Also, operator cardiac activity was measured during the teleoperation task using a Faros 360 electrocardiography system. Lastly, operator mood was assessed just before performing the task using a shortened version of the PANAS questionnaire. A Spearman correlation run on these data revealed several statistical correlations that uncover links between professional task performance, sleep quality and mood in a confined and isolated setting. Amongst them are notably significant correlations between sleep duration and task completion time (? = 0.6197, p < 0.01), the reported feeling of confinement with the negative affect component of the mood (? = 0.5797, p < 0.01), the negative affect component and several sleep quality parameters (? = 0.4686 or 0.4944, p < 0.01).

In the MV, astronauts or other participants should be exposed to psychological and physical stressors similar to those they would encounter on the International Space Station (ISS), such as isolation and confinement, limited habitability, interpersonal issues, microgravity and space radiation; this could lead to the identification of new and previously unknown stressors. To assess the physiological and psychological responses to a stay in a variety of isolated, confined and extreme (ICE) environments, and to survey psychological interpersonal communication between the crew in such environments, a number of confinement studies simulating the conditions of the ISS, the Mir space station and potential habitats on the Moon and Mars, including the Isolation Study for European Manned Space Infrastructure, Experimental Campaign for the European Manned Space Infrastructure, Simulation of Flight of International Crew on Space Station, Human Behavior in Extended Spaceflight, Mars-500, Hawaii Space Exploration Analog and Simulation, and Human Exploration Research Analog, have been conducted. In those studies on responses to ICE environments, astronauts were exposed to psychological stressors such as isolation and confinement, limited habitability and interpersonal issues with crew members and/or ground staff, in addition to physical stressors such as microgravity and space radiation. Excessive psychological stress perturbs the homeostasis of living creatures and can cause tissue damage and disease. In addition, extremely high mental workloads and uncontrolled stressors can impair cognitive abilities such as working memory, executive function and cognitive efficiency. The negative effects of psychological stress on astronauts' health and performance are expected to be a serious issue in the MV because it will be further from Earth and have a longer duration of space flight compared with previous missions. The effects of long-term stays in ICE environments have been studied in the Arctic and Antarctic polar regions.

In this regard, it becomes obvious that crew training and in-flight activities of astronauts cannot be planned without considering intercultural relations, including relevant psychological support of international crews, playing a key role for the success of such space missions. The efficiency of the entire range of activities related to space activities in general depends directly on the ability to build cross-cultural relationships between all stakeholders. The main tool of achieving mutual understanding in any kind of activity in general and the work of astronauts in particular is communication. Communication among the crew of astronauts and with ground control is strongly impacted by their cultural background and in long-duration space missions this impact is strongly aggravated. This paper presents a quantitative complex study of the impact of cultural background of members of an international crew on their information and communication needs with the outside world during long-duration isolation and autonomy during the Mars-500 project. The study has led to the development of a scientifically proven approach to the adaptation of psychological crew support in ground-based isolation studies and long-duration space missions, considering culturally influenced information and communication needs of the international crew members. It was demonstrated that it is necessary to combine the principle of parity of information support in a long-duration autonomous mission of an international crew with the principle of individualization of psychological support, based on the cultural identity and psycho-physiological condition of the crew members.",0,2020-01-01,Conference Paper,NA

This research, which was conducted as part of the NASA Haughton-Mars Project (HMP) on Devon Island, High Arctic, required the adaptation of classical flight test techniques and standardized handling qualities tests in order to evaluate the ease and precision of rotorcraft UAV control with various configurations of spacesuit interface. Quantitative and qualitative data from flight tests were used to compare traditional UAV controls to an innovative interface called the Astronaut Smart Glove (ASG), for potential applications during future Mars surface exploration. The ASG is a prototype human-machine interface (HuMI) and Augmented Reality (AR) system that would allow astronauts to wirelessly operate robotic assets, including drones, via simple hand positions and gestures. This ASG technology and associated head-mounted display (HMD), which were both integrated into an unpressurized concept spacesuit, were successfully evaluated at HMP during a series of handling qualities tests involving the teleoperation of commercial UAVs. Representative tasks and adapted mission task elements (MTEs) from the Aeronautical Design Standard for Handling Qualities Requirements for Military Rotorcraft (ADS-33E-PRF), were successfully applied to assess the handling qualities of commercial rotorcraft drones, when controlled via the ASG and concept spacesuit interface. Flight test results of the ASG suggest that astronauts will plausibly be able to easily and precisely control rotorcraft drones, using only simple hand movements and gestures, for future human missions to Mars.

The study focused on two vehicles in Phase 3 (during 2018 and 2019), one low and one mid lift-to-drag (L/D) vehicle. This paper summarizes updates to the structural and aeroshell outer mold line design for the mid-L/D Mars entry lander vehicle that occurred during EDLAS Phase 3. The design efforts used parametric optimization to arrive at a solution for total vehicle primary and secondary structure mass, and vehicle center-of-gravity location. Additionally, the end of Phase 2 provided an updated surface payload manifest that required three 22 t landers. This paper also summarizes the results of the packaging feasibility study of the updated payload configurations for those three reference missions. The study verified an arrangement of the payload elements within the mid-L/D vehicle that satisfied the center of gravity location limitations for flight.",1,2020-01-01,Conference Paper,National Aeronautics and Space Administration

Private missions could consider persons not restricted by radiation limits; however there remains an interest in the level of risk to be encountered. The major risk for space travel is cancer from galactic cosmic rays (GCR), while circulatory diseases in suggested in some but not all epidemiology studies at modest doses (<1 Gy) and detriments in cognition are suggested by rodent studies following acute irradiation with moderate doses of heavy ions. The GCR are not easily shielded since they consist of high energy protons, heavy ions and secondary radiation produced in shielding and tissue. Furthermore heavy ions are more effective per unit dose in causing solid cancers compared to gamma-rays. In addition non-targeted effects (NTEs) are suggested by most low dose radiobiology studies to increase biological effectiveness for low doses of high LET radiation. Astronauts and cosmonauts are typically above 40-y, while younger aged persons could participate in private space missions. In this paper, we describe cancer and circulatory disease risks for a 940 d Mars mission for average solar minimum conditions for persons of varying ages from 20 to 60 years. For the first-time NTEs are considered in Mars mission cancer risk predictions. Cancer morbidity risks and 95% confidence intervals for age 20-y persons are predicted as 20.9% [7.04, 51.4] and 12.7% [4.97, 29.3] for females and males, respectively. We find that cancer fatality risks decline with age of exposure while circulatory disease risks are nearly independent of age of exposure. The ratio of cancer to circulatory disease fatalities decreases from about 8-to-1 at 20 y to 5-to-1 at 60 y in females and 4-to-1 and 2.5-to-1 in males with about 2-times higher loss of life expectancy for cancer deaths compared to circulatory related deaths, indicating the much higher importance of cancer risk compared to circulatory disease risks for persons participating in space missions.",4,2020-01-01,Article,NA

Grounded in Self-Determination Theory, the objective of the present research was to study how astronauts' basic psychological needs relate to astronaut well-being and mission success, and how Mission Support could foster astronaut need satisfaction. Specifically, we examined how weekly ups and downs in astronauts' need for autonomy, competence and relatedness related to week-to-week fluctuations in a set of positive (i.e., self-endorsed motivation to follow operating procedures, cooperation with Mission Support members, happiness and performance) and negative outcomes (i.e., oppositional defiance towards operating procedures, irritation with Mission Support members and stress) during the Mars simulation HI-SEAS mission 4. Additionally, we examined whether variations in astronauts' needs could be predicted by variations in Mission Support's communication style in interacting with the crew. The study comprised six volunteers, three women and three men, between 25 and 36 years of age (M = 30, SD = 4). The HI-SEAS IV mission simulated a yearlong stay on Mars. During the simulation, measures of autonomy, competence, relatedness with crewmembers and loved-ones at home, well-being, motivation, crew-ground interactions and performance were taken on a weekly basis. The data were analyzed using multilevel analyses. Overall, results indicated significant decreases in the experiences of autonomy as well as relatedness with both crewmembers and loved-ones at home, which aggravated as the mission progressed. Weekly experiences of all three need satisfactions, but in particular autonomy and relatedness with fellow crewmembers, were found to relate positively to weekly variations in self-endorsed motivation, cooperation, happiness and performance, and negatively to weekly variations in oppositional defiance, irritation, and stress. Moreover, week-to-week fluctuations in an autonomy-supportive communication style from Mission Support were found to relate positively, and a controlling style negatively, to weekly fluctuations in the crew's experience of autonomy, competence, and relatedness with crewmembers.

The objective of the present research was to study how the experiences of autonomy relate to crew motivation (i.e., internalization, lack of defiance) and collaboration (i.e., crew-ground cooperation and irritation) during HI-SEAS mission 1, and how crew autonomy relates to Mission Support's perceived communication style in interacting with the crew. The study sample comprised all six volunteers, three women and three men, between 33 and 43 years of age (M = 39, SD = 4), who participated in the HI-SEAS 1 mission, which simulated a four-month-long stay on Mars. During the simulation, measures of Mission Support's perceived autonomy-supportive communication, crew members' autonomy, motivation and crew-ground interactions were taken on a weekly basis during eight weeks. Data were analyzed using multilevel analyses. Results indicated systematic week-to-week variation between constructs, such that greater experiences of autonomy during a given week related to more internalization and acceptance of instructions, less oppositional defiance, and a more fruitful collaboration with ground support that week. Additionally, weekly variations in crew autonomy were positively related to weekly variations in perceived autonomy-supportive communication by Mission Support.

In order to minimize operational risks, efficient communication, problem solving capability and teamwork efficiency, which are considered key behavioural competencies by NASA, have to be tested. It is proposed here to assess the collaboration performance of astronauts in the context of a team spatial orientation task in planetary-analog environments. The experiment was originally designed and tested at the Mars Desert Research Station (crew 185, December 2017). Interestingly, some failures have been observed due to imperfect spatial representation, uncertainties and some communication problems. A similar experiment has been carried out using a virtual environment. N=62 participants have been paired up. Both teammates must collaborate to send a rover to a specific location on a computer simulation of the Mars surface. One person, the astronaut, drives the rover in the virtual environment, orally guided by the captain staying at the base. Every 45 seconds, each participant is asked to mark on his map the location he believes the rover to be. Similarity of teammates spatial shared situational awareness and their accuracy have been used to objectively assess the team performance. Answers to a post-experiment questionnaire have been used to assess perceived communication behaviours of the team. Successful and Unsuccessful teams are compared. Interesting results are presented and discussed. Remarkably, significant differences in terms of Spatial SSA and communication behaviours appeared.",0,2019-01-01,Conference Paper,Direction Générale de l’Armement
85079180325,Interactive interest-based negotiation training for managing conflict in isolated and confined environments,Fleischer J.A.,Conflict management | Isolated environments | Negotiation,"Proceedings of the International Astronautical Congress, IAC",2019-October,NA,NA,NA,"Even in the best planned space missions, disagreements inevitably arise between parties, and the ability to negotiate effectively while maintaining relationships is critical for successful long-duration operations. Traditional positional bargaining can work for simple low-stakes transactions but does not prioritize ongoing relationships. Interest-based negotiation (IBN), where parties with competing interests and/or goals come together to create a mutually beneficial agreement, is crucial in these situations and is a skill we believe can be learned. Using a web-based, interactive-media-approach, we scripted, filmed, and programmed an IBN interactive training module. The module begins with a reference conflict between an International Space Station (ISS) crew and ground control about an upcoming Extra-Vehicular Activity (EVA). The reference conflict reveals the interests each party is trying to meet (the crew has lost trust in ground control due to a previous interaction and wants to move things slowly, while ground control is facing pressure from administration and wants to move ahead quickly) and shows a typical positional negotiation that goes badly. The mentor in the program provides instruction in why the negotiation went poorly and how to use IBN. The user then has the opportunity to revisit the negotiation, try different responses, and receive feedback from the mentor along the way. The user learns how to search for the other person's underlying interests. This module was provided to individuals with a variety of backgrounds for evaluation, including a subset of 9 subjects in isolated and confined environments (ICE) in the Australian Antarctic Program wintering research stations and the HI-SEAS Mars simulation. Feedback was collected (n=33) through both free-response and numerical scaling (0/strongly disagree -> 4/strongly agree). 97% of participants found the activity valuable for learning about conflict management (defined by those who selected either 'somewhat agree' or 'strongly agree'), including 100% of participants in the ICE subset (mode=3). 81% of all participants found the module realistic (mode=4), including 67% of ICE participants (mode=3). Most participants felt this would be valuable to new members of a team in an isolated and confined environment (88% of all participants, mode=4; 78% of ICE subset, mode=3) as well as veterans. This module offers a self-directed, consistent approach to IBN training, which is well received by users. The module could be useful for individuals in isolated and confined environments, as well as for anyone involved in high-stakes negotiation where sustaining relationships is essential. Future work includes further evaluations in Antarctica and with other workgroups.",1,2019-01-01,Conference Paper,National Aeronautics and Space Administration
85079177866,MDRS crew 206's sleep analysis with Dreem: Influence of the mission and the EVAs on sleep quality.,Pouzin N.,NA,"Proceedings of the International Astronautical Congress, IAC",2019-October,NA,NA,NA,"Onboard the International Space Station (ISS), mission durations are increasing, to prepare the future explorations of the Moon and Mars. One of the challenges of long space flights is to understand the behavior of the human body in space. The astronauts' biological activity can be modified during the flight and needs to be studied, such as sleep since it can be unpredictable and even jeopardize a whole mission. Since Skylab and Mir missions, it has been reported that the sleep quality of the crew was seriously impacted in space. From February 24th 2019 to March 17th 2019, six students from ISAE-SUPAERO took part in a Mars analog mission at the Mars Desert Research Station (MDRS 206) in Utah. One of the experiments lead during this mission was sleep monitoring of the crew, by using a portable EEG device. During the mission MDRS 206, daily Extra-Vehicular Activities (EVAs) were conducted. This paper sheds light on the influence of these EVAs and the MDRS 206 mission on the sleep of the crew. It raises the fact that the crew faced an important modification of its sleep during the mission compared to the pre-mission and the post-mission, due to the new environment it had to cope with, and the strict schedule that was imposed. The sleep duration decreased during the mission, and even more during the second and third week: crew members lost an average of 55 minutes of sleep between these two weeks. They also faced a 47% increase of their sleep onset duration (the time to fall asleep). Moreover, the day-type (having an EVA or not) seems to influence key data, as the sleep onset duration. On days with EVA, the time to fall asleep was reduced on average by 24%, compared with days without EVA where the crew members were confined in the station. Precise recommendations can't be given after this experiment, due to the low number of subjects (6 crew members) but trends are relevant enough to pursue this sleep study: the day-type has a strong influence on the sleep quality, therefore working on future mission's schedule is interesting. In 2020, fourteen students from ISAE-SUPAERO will be part of two MDRS missions. Continuing the sleep monitoring of the crews might enable us to gather enough data to draw more precise conclusions.",0,2019-01-01,Conference Paper,NA
85079141093,Aerial vehicles for the inspection of a Martian surface settlement and weather forecast: Testing and considerations for use,Guardabasso P.,Analog | Exploration | Mars | Operations | Unmanned Aerial Vehicle (UAV),"Proceedings of the International Astronautical Congress, IAC",2019-October,NA,NA,NA,"Aerial drones have the potential to revolution planetary exploration, as they can travel higher and faster than rovers but still allowing high-resolution sensing. In recent years, the possibility of using aerial vehicles on Mars went from concept to operations: Mars Helicopter, a small, autonomous rotorcraft developed at the Jet Propulsion Laboratory, scheduled to be launched in 2020, will demonstrate the viability of heavier-than-air vehicles on the Martian surface. Due to the delay of transmission, teleoperated flight from Earth seems unlikely; nevertheless, in a scenario where crew is settled on the Martian surface (or in orbit), aerial drones could become a key element of the mission. Analogue missions have proved to be an effective way to simulate human activities during space exploration missions. Due to crew isolation in a setting similar to the extreme environments of space, they allow for testing of both hardware and operational scenarios. The research project VESTA brought these two subjects together, evaluating possible uses for drones in a human settlement during a two-week experimentation at the Mars Desert Research Station (MDRS). Operational complexity and utility for the crew were analysed, with regard to safety, crew time and training. A multicopter was used during Extra-Vehicular Activities (EVAs) and piloting of the vehicle from inside the station was evaluated. Because of the current absence of a global positioning system on Mars, possible alternative navigation technologies were considered. In this case, due to potential safety issues, flight operations were performed using Earth Global Positioning System (GPS); further studies are therefore required to investigate autonomous navigation on Mars. Two different scenarios were evaluated: environment monitoring and settlement inspection. In the first, the drone was flying at high altitude to acquire a general understanding of the outside environment, and as a possible warning weathercast system for sandstorms, a common event in martian environment. For inspection missions, the drone pointed its cameras and sensors at the station and navigated autonomously to specific points of interest on the MDRS facilities, allowing the crew to inspect the external elements, e.g. the solar array, where the level of dust coverage were assessed. The main results from these evaluations were a set of operational scenarios and lessons learned that could be further extrapolated to real off-Earth conditions in future human exploration missions.",0,2019-01-01,Conference Paper,Mars

However, satisfying only safety requirements will not guarantee mission success. Crew performance can be improved by means of comfort and functional design considerations that accommodate their physical and psychological needs. Currently, the common habitat design approach is based on linear processes, satisfying technical requirements of the mission and providing necessary life support for the crew. Nevertheless, to ensure their well-being and productivity, aesthetic and ergonomic aspects have to be given equal attention throughout the whole design process. Safety and comfort considerations taking into account the hardware's structural and technical requirements must not be neglected. Such habitats need to satisfy exceptional requirements for construction, environmental protection, food production, living conditions and maintenance; they have to ensure safety and emergency response protocols, support the crew's physical health, morale, and productivity. Such strategies fundamentally change the approach to designing habitats and equipment. This paper presents results from bibliographical research, which defines best design practices and recommendations derived from experiences on medium-duration orbiting facilities and extreme environment missions on Earth. The investigated case studies include Skylab, Spacelab, Salyut 7, Mir, and the International Space Station; orbital spacecraft system Shuttle; polar research stations in the Antarctic and Arctic; as well as Earth-based human space mission simulators (e.g., Mars Desert Research Station (MDSR), Mars-500/Sirius-19, Aquarius/NASA Extreme Environment Mission Operations (NEEMO). The research aims to define the optimal balance between the necessary levels of comfort and safety for the crew and associated implications to the spacecraft or habitat design.

One of these analog experiments, the Hawai'i Space Exploration Analog and Simulation (HI-SEAS) studies conditions for a Martian surface crew with constraints on crew isolation, asynchronous communication and self-sufficient power generation. These restrictions require greater crew independence and reliance on local decision-making about resource allocation under variable weather conditions. Habitat power data was collected during the fifth HI-SEAS mission and a model was developed for daily power consumption based on the performance of the photovoltaic array and crew scheduled activities. Using the modeFRONTIER software platform, this power consumption model was optimized for minimal disruption to planned activities with respect to varying power generation. Optimization methods, results and decision parameters are presented here. In addition, an agent-based model application is discussed to add fidelity to the decision parameters. Modular agents could improve the simulation model by better representing trends across multiple analog experiments like changes in resource architecture and crew member composition.

Therefore, to ensure the success of long-term space missions, new factors like confinement and isolation need to be studied. The TELEOP project investigates these effects on crew's performance during Human-Robot Interactions (HRI), such as cargo docking operations or remote control of a rover for surface exploration of the Moon or Mars. Confinement implies living in narrow spaces with limited privacy and isolation having very little contact with people from the outside; those conditions mostly characterize human space missions. In order to study its impact, several analog mission campaigns ave been run within the TELEOP project, such as: MDRS-189 (Mars Desert Research Station - Utah desert) and ARES III (in Lunares Research Base, Poland). The subsequent mission will soon be carried out in the Institute of Bio-Medical Problems of Moscow (IBMP) in Russia, during the SIRIUS-19 campaign (Scientific International Research In a Unique terrestrial Station), with the collaboration of NASA, and the next MDRS-206 expedition. In the following years, the aim is to run the experiment in more realistic and confined environments: the ISS and the Concordia station in Antarctica. In order to assess confinement and isolation and their impact on teleoperation performance, an innovative protocol has been designed. This enables us to have a complete overview on factors linked to teleoperation performance (execution time and accuracy), such as participants' personality traits, affective state and physiological state. Teleoperation performance was evaluated by the guidance of a rover, a task that was performed by each crewmember several times per mission. During the task, physiological activity was recorded using an electrocardiogram (ECG), whereas assessment of both psychological and personality aspects were performed using questionnaires. The latter two intended to assess the mood, motivation, confinement feeling and subjective effort. As a result of the analysis of the data gathered during both the MDRS-189 and ARES III missions, important results were uncovered. The main finding demonstrated a significant correlation between motivation and positive feelings or personality and confinement. Moreover, the outcomes showed a strict link of confinement and teleoperation performance. Thanks to this unique approach in studying the impact of confinement in such realistic environments, TELEOP allows us to learn more about this unexplored field and consequently to better prepare for future missions to Mars and to the Moon.",1,2019-01-01,Conference Paper,NA

The effects of long-term confinement and isolation, exposure to radiation and different gravity forces during space travel could potentially increase the long-term risk of atherosclerosis. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first study determining the status of prothrombogenesis and oxidative stress in six cosmonauts subjected to the longest duration of confined isolation period of 520 days in preparation for prospective undetermined manned space travel to Mars. Materials and Methods: This collaborative research between the National Space Agency (ANGKASA), Universiti Teknologi MARA, Malaysia and Institute of Biomedical Problems (IBMP), Russia was conducted at the Russian Academy of Sciences IBMP, Moscow, Russia. Six multi-national cosmonauts were assigned to live in a ground-based confined module for 520 days. Standard exercise and diet regime were instituted throughout the isolation phase. Six age, ethnic and gender-matched healthy, free-living ground controls were recruited in parallel. Serial serum and whole blood were analysed for biomarkers of prothrombogenesis [plasminogen activator inhibitor-1 (PAI-1) and homocysteine] and oxidative stress [oxidised low-density lipoprotein (ox-LDL) and malondialdehyde (MDA)]. Results: There were significantly lower concentrations of PAI-1 and homocysteine in cosmonauts during confinement compared to the controls. There were no significant differences seen in the concentrations of biomarkers of oxidative stress during confinement but there was a significant percentage change increment for serum MDA in cosmonauts. Conclusion: Long-term confinement decreased the risk of prothrombogenesis and this could be attributed to the exercise and diet regime which includes omega-3 fatty acids supplementation given to the crew members during their confinement period. However, oxidative damage could not be excluded and may be attributed to the influence of psychological stress during this prolonged confinement.",3,2019-01-01,Article,"Ministry of Science, Technology and Space"

Nevertheless, the mechanisms underlying these disturbances and the interactions among different aspects of human adaptation to extreme environments remain to be elucidated. Epigenetic features, like DNA methylation, might be a linking mechanism that explains the involvement of environmental factors between the human genome and the outcome of health. We conducted an exploration of personalized longitudinal DNA methylation patterns of the peripheral whole blood cells, profiling six subjects across six sampling points in the Mars-500 mission. Specifically, we developed a Personalized Epigenetic-Phenotype Synchronization Analysis (PeSa) algorithm to explore glucose- and mood-state-synchronized DNA methylation sites, focusing on finding the dynamic associations between epigenetic patterns and phenotypes in each individual, and exploring the underling epigenetic connections between glucose and mood-state disturbance. Results showed that DMPs (differentially methylated-probes) were significantly enriched in pathways related to glucose metabolism (Type II diabetes mellitus pathway), mood state (Long-term depression) and circadian rhythm (Circadian entrainment pathway) during the mission. Furthermore, our data revealed individualized glucose-synchronized and mood-state-synchronized DNA methylation sites, and PTPRN2 was found to be associated with both glucose and mood state disturbances across all six subjects. Our findings suggest that personalized phenotype-synchronized epigenetic features could reflect the effects on the human body, including the disturbances of glucose and mood-states. The association analysis of DNA methylation and phenotypes, like the PeSa analysis, could provide new possibilities in understanding the intrinsic relationship between phenotypic changes of the human body adapting to long-term isolation environmental factors.",3,2019-01-01,Article,National Natural Science Foundation of China

Since human interactants do not always make rational choices, a good model of their social motivations is needed to explain the strategies of the interactants that are often influenced by social factors and preferences, the feeling of fairness and understanding the need for cooperation. We propose a cognitive model of social preferences of three or more interactants that are engaged in a collaborative game. The game strategies of the interactants are modeled with cooperation ratios and utility functions. We developed a new generalized utility-based approach to model the cooperation and fairness in multiplayer interactions, which uses three utility parameters. In two-person games, as it has been investigated by others, it is impossible to distinguish between fairness and cooperation in the decisions of a given player. We show that in n-person games (n> 2), and with the use of the proposed utility-based approach, it is possible to distinguish between fairness and cooperation. This makes the proposed approach suitable for more detailed analysis of group interactions in a game setting, which can better explain the social motivation of the interactants, than existing utility models and models that utilize on cooperation ratios. We show that the proposed generalization makes the newly proposed utility function less sensitive to the payoffs of one player if the size of the group grows, and test it with data from the MARS-500 isolation experiment.",3,2019-01-01,Article,Nederlandse Organisatie voor Wetenschappelijk Onderzoek

The bone density of lumber vertebrae and femoral proximal epiphysis, as well as the body composition were measured. Statistically significant changes in the mineral density of lumber vertebrae were found in three subjects and displayed different trends from +2.6 to –2.4%. At the same time, in the femoral proximal epiphysis, including in the cervical region, the mineral density after the experiment was significantly lower in all participants. Four subjects exhibited an increase (by 5–9%) in the mineralization of the skull bones, as in some cosmonauts after flights. All participants were characterized by loss of adipose tissue mass (from 2 to 7 kg; in one subject, 20 kg, by a factor of three). Changes in lean mass (by 1–3 kg) were often negative and in the limbs might be associated with preferences for a certain type of physical activity. It is shown that prolonged stay in a confined space can lead to a decrease in mineralization of individual parts of the skeleton. Unlike real spaceflights and long-duration experiments with hypokinesia carried out earlier at the Institute for Biomedical Problems, no clinically significant loss of mineral density (osteoporosis, osteopenia) was observed in the Mars-500 experiment, which may be due to the lack of microgravity effects.",0,2018-12-01,Article,NA

These results demonstrate the principal possibility of predicting the duration of falling asleep by using alpha rhythm spectral analysis. It is assumed that the frequency of the alpha range spectral peak can be a marker of drowsiness and reflect the current need for sleep.,2,2018-06-01,Article,NA

Major human-centered components are trajectory and propulsion (defining HCD in terms of time), life-support (physiological, psychological and social factors), exploration (jobs during flights and on the planet) and anticipation of a Martian civilization (governance, natural and artificial resource management). I will review a few experiments that were conducted so far, such as Mars-500, MDRS and what we are doing in HCD, such as key cognitive and social concepts of operations that rely on situation awareness and decision-making, complexity analysis, dealing with the unexpected, automation and autonomy, and collaborative work. I will develop the perspective that human-systems integration (HSI) is a matter of integrating HCD and systems engineering. We then need to orchestrate the design of the various structures and functions involved in human Mars operations. This orchestration can be made using modeling and human-in-the-loop simulations looking for emerging cognitive and physical functions towards the definition of underlying cyber-physical systems. HSI can be managed in terms of design flexibility, resource commitments, and human-systems knowledge.",1,2018-03-01,Article,NA
85065705361,Mohab: Mobile simulation platform for future moon and Mars missions,Gorski J.,Mobile habitat | Planetary exploration,"Proceedings of the International Astronautical Congress, IAC",2018-October,NA,NA,NA,"One of the greatest challenges of humanity nowadays is building a base on the Moon or Mars. While the idea for such a base is still in the planning phase, it will become a part of our reality within the next 20 years. The MoHab project attempts to address several key elements of this challenge by building analogue of a mobile expeditionary base. The goal of MoHab is to enable long-term field research away from the home base. On the one hand, the project has been inspired by the two existing stationary analogues of Martian bases such as MDRS or Hi-SEAS, and on the other hand it emphasizes mobility and short-term self-sufficiency (up to 5 weeks per rotation). The analog design implies utilization of three 20-foot containers placed on specially adapted trucks. The number of vehicles and the amount of usable space determines the maximum size of the crew (6 people). The architecture of the mission assumes that vehicles move between previously prepared supply points, and they jointly form a temporary habitat during stopovers. This article presents the architecture of the expedition system in detail, as well as the concept of base equipment which takes into account contemporary trends in specialized interior architecture. Moreover, this paper discusses a potential scenario of use of MoHab during the simulation of the Martian mission that will take place in Iceland in 2019 as a part of the upcoming EXO-19 mission.",0,2018-01-01,Conference Paper,NA

One of the issues that are of interest, is the design of spacesuit simulators that provide analogue conditions to crews that usually conduct their missions in extreme environmental conditions, similar to those found on extraterrestrial planetary surfaces. Recently, Colombia has made its first steps in this direction. As a result, the first Colombian space suit simulator has been designed and developed using locally found resources and COTS components. The space suit simulator was developed at the Universidad Nacional de Colombia in collaboration with scientists of the Colombian Air Force. The aim of this device was to accomplish the minimum requirements for training analog astronauts in conditions that resemble a real space suit, like partial hermeticity, and movement constraints. The suit comes complete with life support systems which include ventilation, refrigeration and data acquisition placed in both rigid and flexible structures. The suit was designed taking into account human physiological parameters including body temperature, metabolic rate and heart rate variability, as well as mission requirements such as length of Extravehicular Activity, minimum CO2 concentration in the inner atmosphere and communications with analog command center station. In order to test its functionalities, two sets of controlled environment tests and two sets of field tests of short and long duration were carried out. The results and conclusions of these tests are presented. The laboratory tests were made in the Aerospace Medicine Center of the Colombian Air Force, a first short duration field test was conducted in the Candelaria desert, Colombia, and a long duration test was made during the crew 187 rotation at the Mars Desert Research Station (MDRS). During the tests, particularly the ones performed at the MDRS in 2018, it was observed that the overall performance of the suit was satisfactory, however some improvements are needed, including air distribution system, exhalation gases washout, battery issues and an ergonomic structure. The obtained results have provided relevant information about how the simulator works and improvements that must be made for a second version of the suit.",0,2018-01-01,Conference Paper,NA

One of the insufficiently studied, but important issues are the ethological aspects of interactions and, especially, communicative behavior of people with different level of psychological stability under extreme isolated environments. These studies are becoming popular in space psychology to obtain more knowledge for the optimal interplanetary space crew composition. Presented study was conducted in â€œMars 160â€ experiment, which took place at the base of the Mars Desert Research Station (MDRS) isolation module (USA, Utah). An international crew, consisting of 7 volunteers (4 men and 3 women aged 30 to 58 years) from France, Canada, Japan, Russia, Australia and India took part in the study. During 77 days, life and work on the surface of Mars were simulated. The aim was to study the relationship between emotional stability of the participants and peculiarities of their interactions in a mixed international crew. To obtain the data, the following methods were used: classical sociometric questionnaire (to assess group structure and cohesion), the PSPA (to study interpersonal perception and group dynamics), colors preferences test (to evaluate current emotional state and intensity of anxiety). All methods were administered once in 2 weeks (6 times during isolation) and once after isolation. In addition, video recordings of joint crew breakfasts were conducted at different periods of isolation. The level of group cohesion in the course of simulation of Mars landing operations increased, especially in terms of joint leisure activities. Correlation analysis of sociometric status (popularity), anxiety, integrity of interpersonal perception and Self-image structure, was carried out. Significant negative correlation of anxiety level and sociometric status was found that confirms data from â€œMars-500â€ isolation study. In other words, crewmembers with low anxiety level had higher sociometric status and popularity. Emotional stability, i.e. low anxiety, significantly correlated with higher interpersonal perception's integrity - clear, unambiguous and stable perception of Self and the crewmembers. More anxious crewmembers were characterized by the complex, controversial and diverse perceptions of Self and others. Popular crewmembers were characterized by expressiveness (more gesticulation) in contacts with the crew.",0,2018-01-01,Conference Paper,NA

The results of the investigation showed that hard physical work under the conditions of the experiment led to the formation of the nutritional status against the background of more intensive basal metabolism, elevated metabolism of carbohydrates and lipids, and their increased mobilization from fat depot. Food ration, though it was sufficient to sustain health and fairly high calorie, did not fully meet individual taste preferences of some crewmembers and energy needs for physical activities. Under these conditions, heavy workloads required mobilization of lipids from fat depot and reducedthe hepatic detoxification and metabolic capacities. Self-limitation of eating protein-rich desserts led to a relative deficiency of protein intake. These changes in the diet were the reason why four out of six test subjects reduced their basal metabolism and lost body mass. The recovery of metabolism and slowdown of the body weight loss were achieved under these conditions by supplementing meals with digestible proteincontaining products.",2,2017-12-01,Article,NA

Past space ethological studies have shown adaptive strategies to the tri-dimensional environment, with the goal of optimizing relationships between the astronaut and unusual sensorial-motor conditions. During a long-term interplanetary journey, crewmembers will have to develop new individual and social behaviors to adapt, far from earth, to isolation and confinement and as a result to extreme conditions of living and working together. Recent space psychological studies pointed out that heterogeneity is a feature of interplanetary crews, based on personality, gender mixing, internationality and diversity of backgrounds. Intercultural issues could arise between space voyagers. As a new approach we propose to emphasize the behavioral strategies of human groups' adaptation to this new multicultural dimension of the environment. Methodology Potential outcomes of applying ethological methods to the study of culture-specific human behaviors are investigated. Ethological and anthropological tools are used, based on observations and descriptions of individuals acting in a micro-society with their rules for living, their work habits and their specific customs and values. We focus the present study on interpersonal communications and organizations in diverse space simulation experiments and analogous environments (Mars-500 experiment, Mars Desert Research Station - MDRS, Tara-Arctic expedition and Concordia South pole station). Results During the Mars-500 experiment, the crewmembers (RU, EU, CH) were differently involved in the activities of daily living. At MDRS in the Desert of Utah, the crewmembers (FR, US, AU, DK) communicated differently in verbal discussions. During the Tara drift in the pack ice, the crewmembers (FR, MC, EE, NZ, NO) were differently positioned in the collective space. At Concordia station, the crewmembers (IT, FR) were grouped preferentially according to their living habits. The results show that cultural heterogeneity has different effects on interpersonal communications and organizations. When considering the isolated and confined crews like an evolving micro-society in unexplored environments, our preliminary analysis raises new questions as to the phylogenetic and epigenetic bases to which cultural ethology linked to anthropology may help to answer. Conclusion Cultural values, in addition to social values and personal values, have to be taken into consideration for future space exploration.",3,2017-10-01,Conference Paper,European Space Agency

Methods: Six volunteers were recruited; all were male aged 26–38 years (average 31.83±4.96 years). Characteristic parameters reflflecting the status of cardiovascular functions were extracted, which included left ventricular contraction, vascular elasticity and peripheral resistance. The degree of fatigue was determined depending on the difference between the calendar age and biological age, which was calculated through the analysis of blood pressure value and characteristic parameters. Based on the values of pulse height variation and pulse time variation on a 30-s pulse graph, autonomic nervous function was evaluated. All parameters examined were marked on an equilateral polygon to form an irregular polygon of the actual fifigure, then health status was evaluated based on the coverage area of the actual fifigure. Results: The results demonstrated: (1) volunteers developed weakened pulse power, increased vascular tension and peripheral resistance, and slight decreased ventricular systolic function; (2) the degree of fatigue was basically mild or moderate; and (3) autonomic nervous function was excited but generally balanced. Conclusions: These volunteers were in the state of sub-health. According to Chinese medicine theories, such symptoms are mainly caused by the weakening of healthy qi, Gan (Liver) failing in free coursing, and disharmony between Gan and Wei (Stomach), which manifests as a weak and string-like pulse.",5,2017-08-01,Article,NA

Therefore, the effectiveness of countermeasures of reduced physical activity was studied using some parameters of the immune system. Our purpose was to examine how different types of exercises can modify physical performance and immune function in six subjects volunteered for Mars-500 simulation study. During the study, the resistance and cyclic training alternated over the period of about two months. According to the design, training was interrupted twice by an interval of approximately one month. The training plan was developed so that the initial and final stages of isolation could not impair the effectiveness of training. The cyclic training included running on the motorized and non-motorized treadmill and bicycling. Resistance exercises were performed using the MDS multifunctional exercise machine, expanders, and the Galileo 2000 vibration plate. Physical performance was assessed by the criteria of maximal voluntary effort, incremental locomotion, and bicycle exercise tests. Analysis of the quantitative and functional properties of effector cells of both innate and adaptive immunity was employed to investigate the immune status of subjects. Due to the plan of physical training, the level of physical performance in isolation was better than during the baseline data collection, although the intervals caused a considerable decrease in performance. Comparison of immunograms with the baseline ones showed positive changes: the number of naive CD4+Т-cells (CD4+CD45RA+) increased significantly. The functional activity of adaptive immunity did not reduce during isolation; on the contrary, the ability of T cells to express the early activation marker CD69+ on the surface was increased. The immune status parameters assessed in the subjects in the second half of the isolation period indicate that the proposed physical loads were adequate.

85051423626,The benefits of lower extremity loading in space due to the seated execution of ordinary calf raises and the leg press on human subjects,Angeli T.,Exercise | MDS,"Proceedings of the International Astronautical Congress, IAC",3,NA,1892-1894,NA,"An exercise regimen was performed on the Multifunctional Dynamometer for Application in Space (MDS) by a crew of 6 astronauts and cosmonauts during the ""Mars-500"" isolation project. This intensive testing focused on the durability, efficiency and performance characteristics of the exercise countermeasure device. Therefore it provided comprehensive qualitative and quantitative feedback, demonstrated exciting potentials, but also addressed some limitations of the overall construction. Consequently, the MDS ran through some minor modifications leading to an optimised usability of the device. Since then another measurement series based on additional measuring instruments has been realised, leading to various load profiles derived from a larger and more heterogeneous group of people. Together with the related survey-based feedback obtained from all test subjects, those new insights were assessed and brought into accordance with existing findings. In this study, the newly constructed leg press sled of the MDS was predominantly used for high intensive loading exercises (e.g. Leg Press, Leg Press Calf Raises). This setup leads to greater generation of loads on certain bone sites during countermeasure exercises compared to other devices. Especially, Leg Press Calf Raises are noted to generate high forces, which might lead to the preservation of distal tibia bone mass. Together with the common Leg Press exercise it should be performed dynamically in a single-legged mode, for better generation of osteogenic stimulus. To that end these two exercises are chosen with good reason, because they are spine-protective and allow the implementation of higher active forces on certain structures without harming the trunk. They mainly affect the lower limb as target area of intensive loading, by not transmitting high loads throughout the whole body (e.g. Squat). In this study our aim is to calculate the load on the tibia and femur due to the ground reaction forces (GRF) resulting from exercises performed on the MDS. The study group consisted of 26 healthy subjects (13 women, 13 men) and the data acquisition included a full motion analysis via a motion capturing system and force recordings using a ground force plate. The modelling of the lower limb is based on the principles of classical mechanics, since external generated forces like GRF's are caused by internal forces like muscle forces. The calculated average load on tibia is up to 6.6 times body weight during Leg Press and 8.8 times body weight during Calf Raise. Even though calf raise produced higher load on tibia, the Leg Press exercise cannot be excluded as it comparatively generated higher forces on the femur. Hence both exercises are recommended for the bones of the lower extremity.",0,2017-01-01,Conference Paper,NA

Considered solution will be thoroughly tested during University Rover Challenge 2016 aiding #next team efforts to proof life existence in mock-up Mars surface setting located nearby Mars Desert Research Station, Hanksville Utah. This procedure is one of the challenge’s tasks that proves the scientific usefulness of a built rover. It requires the collection of an unaltered sub-surface soil sample, preliminary examination and cashing it onboard for further analysis. The device needs to be capable of collecting sub-surface soil samples, then transporting gathered material to cash and experiment containers also embedded onto platform [3]. It uses a drilling technique similar to the one used to crush concrete and hard rocks. Powder created during sampling is further transported via a system of tubes powered with a vacuum. To create under pressure system was equipped with high-efficient turbine capable of producing up to 45 kg of suction force. This new approach has never been used before during such competition.

The two groups exhibited different dynamics of the night sleep structure. Difficulties with falling asleep in G-1 arose on the eve of “landing onto Mars” and end of the experiment, whereas in G-2 they were evident prior to the end only.

Computer-based behavioral health countermeasures are appealing for training and treatment in ICEs because they provide confidentiality and do not require communication with the outside environment. We evaluated the Virtual Space Station (VSS), a suite of interactive computer-delivered psychological training and treatment programs, at the Hawaii Space Exploration Analog and Simulation (HI-SEAS) III expedition. METHODS: Six subjects (3 male, 3 female) spent 8 mo in group-isolation and used the Conflict, Stress, and Depression modules in the VSS. Survey evaluations, data collected within the program, and postdeployment interviews were collected. RESULTS: This crew dealt with behavioral health issues common to ICEs. The VSS proved to be a valuable resource and was used both as intended, and in unanticipated ways, to help maintain behavioral health. The Conflict and Stress Modules were rated as highly acceptable (1.8 on a 7-point Likert scale). The crew identified a total of 13 stressors and worked on 9 problems through the VSS. Opinions about the modules were highly individualized. Crewmembers identified exercises in the VSS that were applicable and not applicable to their needs. Additional content to improve the program was identified. DISCUSSION: Autonomous, confidential training and treatment for behavioral health issues will need to be a critical component of long duration spaceflight travel.

We examined the ways crew members described their experiences and their life during simulation, what they saw as key episodes and key topics in simulation, as well as key problems and key benefits. The aim of this paper is to present the Mars-500 simulation in its complexity, from beginning to end, as a one narrative story. Method Two weeks after the end of isolation we used narrative qualitative interviews in order to understand the unique experience of the crew members living and working in isolation and confinement. During our 'Flight Story Interview' (an adaptation of McAdamśs Life Story Interview) crew members reconstructed a story about their life in a module and revealed important points and processes during simulation: crew members identified and described the peak experience, nadir experience, turning points, important scenes and challenges and other narrative moments that create a story of a simulated flight to Mars. The narratives were subjected to horizontal thematic analysis. The story reconstruction completes quotes from crew membeŕs diaries published online by the European Space Agency. Results The results showed that for the crew members the peak experiences of simulation were celebrations, video messages from significant others, and the Mars landing, and that the most difficult moments were connected with delay or loss of communication and monotony during the second half of the experiment. The turning points were connected with the Mars episode. Crew members highlighted other crucial scenes and topics of the project Mars-500 in their narratives, and stressed the issues of food, coping strategies, or benefits of cultural heterogeneity in an extreme and confined environment.",7,2016-09-01,Article,NA

However, the variability in protein abundance in the context of normal homeostasis remains a major challenge in urinary proteomics. In this study, the analysis of urine samples collected from healthy individuals, rigorously selected to take part in the MARS-500 spaceflight simulation program, provided a unique opportunity to estimate normal concentration ranges for an extended set of urinary proteins. In order to systematically identify and reliably quantify peptides/proteins across a large sample cohort, a targeted mass spectrometry method was developed. The performance of parallel reaction monitoring (PRM) analyses was improved by implementing tight control of the monitoring windows during LC-MS/MS runs, using an on-the-fly correction routine. Matching the experimentally obtained MS/MS spectra with reference fragmentation patterns allowed dependable peptide identifications to be made. Following optimization and evaluation, the targeted method was applied to investigate protein abundance variability in 56 urine samples, collected from six volunteers participating in the MARS-500 program.

85016508734,Utility of additive manufacturing on martian analogs and manned mars missions,Wilsona Z.,3D printing | Additive Manufacturing | Analog | HI-SEAS | In-Space Manufacturing | Mars,"Proceedings of the International Astronautical Congress, IAC",NA,NA,NA,NA,"The potential utility of additive manufacturing was explored during an 8 month Mars analog mission at the HI-SEAS (Hawaii Space Exploration Analog and Simulation) habitat. A manufacturing capability is critical to a successful Mars mission. Breakdowns of important equipment are inevitable. The ability to manufacture replacement parts can reduce the number of spares required and therefore the cost of the mission. Unanticipated problems over the course of a long mission will require improvised solutions. A flexible manufacturing method like additive manufacturing allows the greatest variety of parts to be produced from the minimum of raw materials and equipment. During the course of HI-SEAS mission 3 more than 730 individual pieces were made, mostly based on the 60 or so parts designed by crew members. About 2/3 of these were practical parts (e.g. habitat repair/improvement, tools, scientific instruments) while the remaining 1/3 were fun parts (e.g. toys, presents for crew members, parts for games). In addition to the practical upsides there were less tangible benefits as well. Life during the mission was quite predictable, surprises tended to be generally negative (e.g systems breaking or not working properly). Especially during travel to and from Mars, monotony, boredom and depression have the potential to reduce team effectiveness/preparedness. The ability to manufacture presents and fun items (including ones made from digital files sent by family and friends on Earth) have the potential to increase moral. The ability to manufacture parts provided the crew with a sense of independence and satisfaction. The manufacturing was done on a consumer level fused deposition modeling type machine that uses a few types of plastic (e.g ABS, nylon, PET and PLA). While these materials were useful in a Mars analog they aren't well suited to either the vacuum of space or the environment of the Martian surface due to extreme temperatures and low pressures. There are other types of 3D printers, like selective laser sintering, that can make parts out metal powders which might be more appropriate. There are few characteristics that make 3D printers well suited to this particular use. They produce minimal waste when compared to traditional subtractive manufacturing. The raw materials they require (generally filament, powder or pellets) tend to be easier to produce than the material required for sub-tractive manufacturing (larger blocks) as well, meaning local production or recycling of unneeded parts is more feasible.",0,2016-01-01,Conference Paper,NA
85016491918,Cultural ethology as new approach of interplanetary crew's behavior,Tafforin C.,NA,"Proceedings of the International Astronautical Congress, IAC",NA,NA,NA,NA,"Introduction: From an evolutionary perspective, during short-term and medium-term orbital flights, human beings developed new spatial and motor behaviors to compensate for the lack of terrestrial gravity. Past space ethological studies have shown adaptive strategies to the tri-dimensional environment with the goal of optimizing relationships between the astronaut and unusual sensorial-motor conditions of moving. During a long-term interplanetary journey, crewmembers will have to develop new individual and social behaviors to adapt, far from Earth, to isolation and confinement and as a result to extreme conditions of living and working together. Recent space psychological studies pointed out that heterogeneity is the feature of interplanetary crews; based on personality, gender mixing, internationality and diversity of backgrounds. Intercultural issues could arise between space voyagers. As a new approach we propose to emphasize the behavioral strategies of the human group's adaption to this new multicultural dimension of the environment. Methodology: Potential outcomes of applying ethological methods to the study of culture-specific human behaviors are investigated. They use anthropological tools based on observations and descriptions of individuals acting in a microsociety with their rules for living, their work habits and their specific customs and values. We intend to focus the present study on interpersonal communications and organizations in diverse space simulation experiments and analogous environments (Mars-500 experiment, Mars Desert Research Station - MDRS, Tara-Arctic expedition and Concordia South pole station). Results: During the Mars-500 experiment, the crewmembers (RU, EU, CH) were differently involved in the daily life activities. At MDRS in the Desert of Utah, the crewmembers (F, USA, AUS, D) differently communicated in verbal discussions. During the Tara drift in the pack ice, the crewmembers (F, USA, EST, NZ, N, RUS) were diversely positioned in the collective space. At Concordia station, the crewmembers (I, F) were grouped preferentially according to their living habits. The results show that cultural heterogeneity has different impacts on interpersonal communications and organizations. When considering the isolated and confined crews like an evolving microsociety in unexplored environments, our preliminary analysis raises new questions on phylogenetic and epigenetic bases to witch cultural ethology associated with anthropology may help to answer. Conclusion: Cultural values in addition to social values and personal values, have to be taken into consideration for future space exploration.",0,2016-01-01,Conference Paper,NA

Seventeen apparently healthy men aged 25–46 years were examined. The statistical data treatment included the correlation and one-way analysis of variance. The comparison of the number of statistical correlations of the sum of all functional parameters in the subjects showed that they were most often sensitive to atmospheric pressure, temperature, relative humidity, partial oxygen pressure (29–35%), and geomagnetic activity (28%).

In particular, clinical studies about the association between migration and increased risk of atopy/asthma have provided important information on the role of migration associated large sets of environmental exposures in the development of allergic diseases. However, investigations about environmental effects on immune responses are mostly limited in candidate environmental exposures, such as air pollution. The influences of large sets of environmental exposures on immune responses are still largely unknown. A simulated 520-d Mars mission provided an opportunity to investigate this topic. Six healthy males lived in a closed habitat simulating a spacecraft for 520 days. When they exited their ""spacecraft"" after the mission, the scenario was similar to that of migration, involving exposure to a new set of environmental pollutants and allergens. We measured multiple immune parameters with blood samples at chosen time points after the mission. At the early adaptation stage, highly enhanced cytokine responses were observed upon ex vivo antigen stimulations. For cell population frequencies, we found the subjects displayed increased neutrophils.

The method was developed to analyze the video recordings of facial expressions depicted during a collaborative game played as a part of the Mars-500 experiment. In this experiment, six astronauts were isolated for 520 days in a space station to simulate a flight to Mars. Seven time-dependent components of facial expressions were extracted from the video recordings of the experiment. To interpret these dynamic components, we proposed a mathematical model of emotional events. Genetic programming was used to find the locations, types, and intensities of the emotional events as well as the way the recorded facial expressions represented reactions to them. By classification of different statistical properties of the data, we found that there are significant relations between the facial expressions of different crew members and a memory effect between the collective emotional states of the crew members. The model of emotional events was validated on previously unseen video recordings of the astronauts. We demonstrated that both genetic search and optimization of the parameters improve the accuracy of the proposed model.

We examined the issue of distinct environmental factors, isolation vs. confinement, which may have different or similar impacts on crews' behavioral manifestations for long-term adaptation, such as on a Mars mission. The Tara expedition was a 507-d polar drift of the Tara schooner embedded in the Arctic ice with two successive periods of summer and winter-over in an isolated environment. The Mars-500 experiment took place in Moscow and was a 520-d simulation of a trip to Mars, the Mars landing, and the return trip to Earth in a confined environment. METHODS: We used the ethological method based on observation, description, and quantification of individual and interindividual behaviors. These events were scored from video recordings made during daily life activities and aggregated according to the summer period and to the outgoing trip for the whole crew (N = 6) for each situation, respectively. RESULTS: We did not observe differences in the frequency of facial expressions and in the duration of body interactions. Conversely, there were differences in the frequency of collateral acts and in the duration of personal actions with the highest levels during the Mars-500 experiment (0.52/min and 41,799 s); the highest level of visual interactions was observed during the Tara expedition (33,167 s).

84991503909,Load on tibia during seated execution of ordinary calf raises on the multifunctional dynamometer for application in space (MDS),Angeli T.,NA,"Proceedings of the International Astronautical Congress, IAC",1,NA,10-12,NA,"An exercise regimen of the Multifunctional Dynamometer for Application in Space (MDS) was performed by a crew of 6 astronauts and cosmonauts during the ""Mars-500"" isolation project. This intensive testing focused on the capabilities, durability and efficiency of the exercise countermeasure device. It also provided valuable qualitative and quantitative feedback. In addition this revealed the potential and limitations of the overall construction. The evaluation of miscellaneous responses and basic discussions led to further measurements on the device. The MDS met a recently postulated appeal pointing out the need for an additional aerobic training feature within a single device (Hackney et al., 2012). Further constructional demands concerning compactness, costs and maintenance of future exercise equipment were also issued by Hackney and colleagues - established in cooperation with NASA's Exercise Physiology & Countermeasures Project. We are confident that the MDS fulfils all of the above-mentioned requirements due to its beneficial design, which would provide a remedy in this particular field. The leg press sled of the MDS is used for high intensive loading exercises (e.g. Leg Press, Leg Press Calf Raises). Intensive loading exercises of other developments (e.g. Running, Squat) have been quantitatively confirmed as being inadequate on board of the ISS (Genc, 2011). With our setup we are convinced to generate greater loads on certain bone sites during countermeasure exercise compared to other devices. Especially Leg Press Calf Raises (LPCR) could produce such high forces, which should preserve at least the distal tibia bone mass. Together with the common Leg Press exercise (LP) it should be performed in a highly dynamic manner via single-legged execution, to generate a better osteogenic stimulus. These two exercises are chosen because they work in a spine-protective way and allow the implementation of higher active forces on certain structures without harming the trunk. Beyond that, they mainly affect the lower limb as target area of intensive loading, not transmitting high loads throughout the whole body (in contrast to Squats). A force plate was installed on the footplate and investigations of the training behaviour for a representative number of subjects occurred. The results of this study are presented and discussed within the results section.",0,2015-01-01,Conference Paper,Universität Wien

Motivated by the vision of facilitating full-body immersion for effortless space exploration, it is necessary to understand the sensory needs of astronauts during extra-vehicular activities (EVAs). In this paper, we present the outcomes from a two-week field study performed at the Mars Desert Research Station, a facility where crews carry out Mars-simulated missions. We used a combination of methods (a haptic logbook, technology probes, and interviews) to investigate user needs for haptic feedback in EVAs in order to inform the design of a haptic glove. Our results contradict the common belief that a haptic technology should always convey as much information as possible, but should rather offer a controllable transfer. Based on these findings, we identified two main design requirements to enhance haptic feedback through the glove: (i) transfer of the shape and pressure features of haptic information and (ii) control of the amount of haptic information. We present the implementation of these design requirements in the form of the concept and first prototype of ExoSkin. ExoSkin is a morphing haptic feedback layer that augments spacesuit gloves by controlling the transfer of haptic information from the outside world onto the astronauts’ skin.",6,2015-01-01,Conference Paper,European Commission

I. Grigor’ev. The monograph Concepts of Health in Space Medicine was published in 2007 and described principles for assessing health in essentially healthy people working in conditions of chronic stress. These principles were put into practice in the same year by development of the Ecosan-2007 apparatus. This was trialed on bus drivers and civil pilots and has been used in the Mars 500 project since 2009. All these developments and investigations were performed with the support of the “Basic sciences – medicine” Program of the Presidium of the Russian Academy of Sciences and the initiator and coordinator of the investigations was Academician A. I. Grigor’ev. In the Mars 500 project, six members of an international “Mars” crew were studied in a hermetically sealed chamber simulating a spacecraft. The Ecosan-2007 apparatus was used, among others. This apparatus was used to assess a further 125 subjects in 12 different parts of the world, living in natural social-industrial conditions. These long-term medical-ecological studies yielded important experimental grounds for a preclinical approach to assessment of health. A methodology for the remote assessment of the effects of ecological factors on health was developed in the framework of these studies, and this gave rise to a new applied scientific area – telemedicine ecology.

Seven permanent proteins with predominant distribution in the liver and blood plasma as well as extracellular localization were identified. Analysis of the overrepresentation of the molecular functions and biological processes based on Gene Ontology revealed that the functional association among these proteins was low.

While launching with a small article on DLR's website, the press attention for this mission grew significantly in the weeks after the simulated trip to Mars. In this paper the media coverage of this research stay at MDRS is described and it is investigated how the apparent interest of the public in human spaceflight missions can and should be increased by improving awareness of analogue test site operations and missions and increasing the coverage of a human and emotional side rather than an exclusively technical point of view for such missions. The costs involved in EuroMoonMars B are related to the media outcome to show that for a humble investment, public interest can be triggered. The author describes further how enhancing analogue test site utilization helps increase public support and also is a legit way of justifying spendings on human missions to other planets.

84938149062,Greenhouse automation. Illumination and expansion study for mars desert research station,Poulet L.,NA,"Proceedings of the International Astronautical Congress, IAC",13,NA,9714-9724,NA,"A partially or fully autonomous food production facility is one of the most important elements in any extraterrestrial settlement. The GreenHab, the greenhouse of the Mars Desert Research Station (MDRS). provides an excellent opportunity for an expansion study, considering it both as an experimental facility for crop growth but also as a food provider for the crew. The current GreenHab is a basic horizontal cylindrical structure divided into two parts. The larger part is used for vegetables growth over the season, which are harvested and consumed by the latest crews in rotation at the station. It also provides the opportunity to perform experiments within the greenhouse facility. The second part is dedicated to the crew well-being in form of a Zen garden with flowers. The MDRS GreenHab is an independent module linked to the main habitat through a corridor. Full integration of the greenhouse module into the habitat would be preferable since on top of participating to food production it could directly support air revitalization and water recycling, which are life-critical processes related to all human operations in the base. The MDRS internal environment suffers from extremely low humidity (e.g., 18-22 % during February) due to its location in the high desert of Utah and also due to its heat and ventilation air conditioning system design that is not integrated with the other base subsystems. An integrated greenhouse could improve the atmosphere quality and decrease crew health risks as well as increase their comfort and work efficiency. Greenhouse systems are not hazardous (in opposition to some power systems requiring specific distance from the base due to possible life endangering failures) and thus do not require protective zoning apart from the habitation unit, which makes their integration into the habitat a plausible scenario. This paper presents number of approaches and options for the GreenHab automation, illumination and capacity expansion based on various research, production and base operations interests. Currently the GreenHab requires much crew time for maintenance and daily operations, which could be reduced by at least a third using automation techniques. The use of supplemental lighting would also greatly improve light conditions inside the GreenHab, therefore enhancing crop growth and yield of the greenhouse. There are numerous options for the GreenHab expansion such as: modular, dome radial, detached, attached from pre-fabricated components, self-deployable or built of in-situ resources depending on the level of habitat and greenhouse simulations and structures fidelity.",2,2014-01-01,Conference Paper,NA
84938092382,Problem of individual norm and assessment of adaptation risks in space and on earth,Chernikova A.,NA,"Proceedings of the International Astronautical Congress, IAC",1,NA,93-97,NA,"Projects, related to interplanetary missions, are developed intensively. Humans are able to live and work in microgravity without significant changes in basic vital systems. It is important precondition for successful implementation of these plans. Long-term studies during and after long stays on orbital stations did not reveal any abnormalities that could prevent the gradual increase in the duration of space flights. However, the developing of principles and instruments for dynamic assessing and monitoring of health status remains relevant. A similar problem is also facing the Earth medicine, where there are practically no means for controlling functional conditions in healthy subjects. The concept about role of cardiovascular system as indicator of adaptive abilities, since it provides adaptive reactions to the environment, was introduced in space medicine. Based on this concept prenosological approach considers health as adaptation abilities, that allows us to evaluate and predict its possible changes by the level of functionality and degree of regulatory systems stress. Applied to long-term space flights, we have proposed previously the concept of adaptive risk and the method for its assessment according to heart rate variability (HRV) analysis. This method has been tested in space investigations (ECG at orbital station ""Mir"", 39 cosmonauts, experiments ""Pulse"", ""Pneumocard"" and ""Sonocard"" in 27 cosmonauts in Russian ISS segment) and in terrestrial project ""Mars-500"" (6 members of the 'Martian' crew and 120 subjects in parallel studies). The analysis of experimental data confirmed a major role of autonomic regulation in adaptive reactions of the human body. When carrying out functional tests (the deep breathing test and orthostatic test) it was demonstrated that HRV decreasing is associated with reduced functional abilities and increased adaptation risk. During readaptation after space flight it is particularly evident in the postural tolerance (orthostatic tachycardia). By the results of ""Mars-500"" project, adaptive risk increases accordingly to workloads of the crew and the environmental loads in people living in different climatic and geographical conditions. The obtained results have also revealed that the adaptive responses of healthy subjects both in space and on Earth are characterized by pronounced individuality. One of the most pressing problems now is to design further the concept of adaptation risks and preventive approach to health assessment towards the developing of criteria and instruments for determining individual norms. We propose some new approaches to take into account individual differences which will allow more surely assess autonomic status and health.",0,2014-01-01,Conference Paper,NA

84938056347,Next generation suit designs - Taking lessons from current analogue suit designs,Graham P.,NA,"Proceedings of the International Astronautical Congress, IAC",5,NA,3250-3253,NA,"Wim renewed interest and activity in returning to the Moon, Mars, and other space operations, significant thought must be given to Lunar Surface Suit (LSS), Mars Surface Suit (MSS), or Space Activity Suit (SAS) designs. Factors to be considered include physical, data, and human factor issues. Specifics include mission duration requirements, availability of consumables, power, waste management, communications, data management, entertainment and other operator needs. Since the physical requirements are defined by the mission, they are minimum requirements. Data and human factors will also be considered minimum requirements, while other needs are more flexible, and should be driven by the individual mission. These needs are best defined through extensive analog testing in a relevant environment performing realistic and relevant tasks. Therefore, analog suits should be designed as close as practicable to their real counterparts, and real suits should be designed from the lessons learned in the use and testing of their analogs. From 2001 until 2007, the author oversaw operations at the Mars Desert Research Station (MDRS) and Flashline Mars Arctic Research Station (FMARS), observing simulations using primitive analog suits, and gathering data on suit functionality from the perspective of the experienced field scientists and engineers who use them. Since then, the author has been working with the OpenLuna and Kepler Shipyards suit development team in designing and developing an LSS that will meet or exceed their own and NASA requirements. Examination of existing analogue usage suggests that the following features should also be included in both analogue and space-worthy suits: food and water supply; carbon dioxide, liquid, and solid waste disposal; in-suit communications and navigation; temperature control; remote medical access; radiation shielding; environmental protection; mobile power sources; and resource recycling. Rescue and recovery of an injured explorer or a damaged suit is also required. Available to the operator will be local copies of documentation, mapping and other data resources. Entertainment will be considered to maintain morale during long transits, tedious tasks, or during emergencies. Lastly, me suit must be modular, manufactured with low-cost, easy to maintain and clean, durable enough to provide physical protection and must be able to operate in a wide variety of environments, with variable outerwear for special needs. All of the features should be extensively tested in an analogue environment before introduction into space-worthy suits, and any changes in the real suit needs should be reflected in their analog counterparts.",0,2014-01-01,Conference Paper,NA

We examined the ways crewmembers of a 520-day simulated spaceflight to Mars (held in the Institute for Biomedical Problems, in Moscow) experienced and regulated their moods and emotions. Results show that crewmembers experienced predominantly positive emotions throughout their 520-day isolation and the changes in mood of the crewmembers were asynchronous and balanced. The study suggests that during the simulation, crewmembers experienced and regulated their emotions differently than they usually do in their everyday life. In isolation, crewmembers preferred to suppress and neutralize their negative emotions and express overtly only emotions with positive valence. Although the affective processes were almost invariable throughout the simulation, two periods of time when the level of positive emotions declined were identified. Regarding the findings, the paper suggests that changes in positive affectivity could be a more valuable indicator of human experience in demanding but professional environments than changes in negative affectivity.

And for human on Earth, more and more people live in an isolated condition, which has become a common social problem in modern western society. Collective evidences have indicated prolonged chronic stress could bring big influence to human immune function, which may lead to a variety of health problems. However, to what extent long-term isolation can affect the immune system still remains largely unknow. A simulated 520-d Mars mission provided an extraordinary chance to study the effect of prolonged isolation. Six healthy males participated in this mission and their active neuroendocrine and immune conditions were studied with saliva and blood samples from all participants on chosen time points during the isolation period. As a typical neuroendocrine parameter, stress hormone cortisol was measured in the morning saliva samples. Immune phenotype changes were monitored through peripheral leukocyte phenotype analysis. Using an ex vivo viral infection simulation assay we assessed the immune response changes characterized by the ability to produce representative endogenous pro-inflammatory cytokines. The results of this study revealed elevated cortisol levels, increased lymphocyte amount and heightened immune responses, suggesting that prolonged isolation acting as chronic stressors are able to trigger leukocyte phenotype changes and poorly controlled immune responses. © 2014 Elsevier Inc.",26,2014-01-01,Article,National Aeronautics and Space Administration

Among the different causes promoting sleep alterations, such as circadian rhythms disruption and microgravity, stress is of great interest also for earth-based sleep medicine. This study aims to evaluate the relationships between stress related to social/environmental confinement and sleep in six healthy volunteers involved in the simulation of human flight to Mars (MARS500).Volunteers were sealed in a spaceship simulator for 105. days and studied at 5 specific time-points of the simulation period. Sleep EEG, urinary cortisol (24. h preceding sleep EEG recording) and subjectively perceived stress levels were collected. Cognitive abilities and emotional state were evaluated before and after the simulation. Sleep EEG parameters in the time (latency, duration) and frequency (power and hemispheric lateralization) domains were evaluated. Neither cognitive and emotional functions alterations nor abnormal stress levels were found. Higher cortisol levels were associated to: i) decrease of sleep duration, increase of arousals, and shortening of REM latency; ii) reduction of delta power and enhancement of sigma and beta in NREM N3; and iii) left lateralization of delta activity (NREM and REM) and right lateralization of beta activity (NREM).Stressful conditions, even with cortisol fluctuations in the normal range, alter sleep structure and sleep EEG spectral content, mirroring pathological conditions such as primary insomnia or insomnia associated to depression. Correlations between cortisol fluctuations and sleep changes suggest a covert risk for developing allostatic load, and thus the need to develop ad-hoc countermeasures for preventing sleep alterations in long lasting manned space missions. © 2014 Elsevier B.V.",27,2014-01-01,Article,Agenzia Spaziale Italiana

Polysomnography recordings of six healthy men were performed before, four times during and after 520-days confinement. During the isolation sleep efficiency and delta-latency decreased, while sleep latency increased mainly one month and half before the end of the isolation. Post-hoc analysis demonstrated significant differences between background and the last measure during isolation. Frequency of the nights with low sleep efficiency significantly increased before important events for the subjects, those like simulation of Mars landing and the end of the confinement. Two weeks after landing simulation the amount of the nights with low sleep efficiency significantly decreased. Therefore, anticipation of the significant event during long-term isolation might be an additional factor for sleep worsening and result in difficulties to fall asleep in previously healthy men. © 2013 Pleiades Publishing, Inc.",3,2013-11-01,Article,NA

We present the Mars-500 experiment, which took place in Moscow, Russia, over 520 d from June 5, 2010, to November 4, 2011. It was designed to simulate a 250-d interplanetary mission from Earth to Mars, a 30-d orbital stay with a Mars landing, and a 240-d interplanetary mission from Mars back to Earth. The six-person crew was composed of three Russians, two Europeans, and one Chinese. Methods: We applied the ethological method based on observation, description, and quantification of nonverbal behavior expressed by actions and interactions, as well as verbal behavior expressed through positions and communications. These events were scored with The Observer XT w software from video recordings made every 2 wk during a daily life activity at breakfast time and every month during a group discussion task. Results: We show that the frequency of occurrences of personal actions, visual interactions, facial expressions and collateral acts are linked to certain phases, periods, and temporal points of the mission. Verbal communications in English and in Russian involve prevalent language associated with place preferences and preferential relationships among the crewmembers. Discussion: We found evidence that the Mars-500 crew behavior was dependent on time, culture, and the individual. © the Aerospace Medical Association, Alexandria, VA.",12,2013-10-24,Article,NA
84883694769,Planetary analogues EVA medical emergency simulations: Transportation methods,Diaz A.R.,NA,43rd International Conference on Environmental Systems,NA,NA,NA,NA,"Future NASA planetary exploration will call for extended human presence in space, with long term missions to the Moon, Mars, and/or asteroids. This human presence in extraterrestrial locations will require use of planetary surface Extra-Vehicular Activities (EVAs), which will involve inherently dangerous procedures that can put crew safety at risk. One need only peruse proposed EVA operations for future planetary surface missions to understand the risks astronauts will be exposed to. These EVAs will include activities such as base construction, base operation and maintenance, emergency and safety procedures, planetary surface exploration, planetary surface science, robotic operation and maintenance, and in-situ resource utilization (ISRU) operations. To help mitigate EVA medical risks, astronaut training programs will spend substantial attention on preparing for planetary surface EVA emergencies. To this end, the Mars Desert Research Station (MDRS) and Haughton Mars Project (HMP) provide excellent analogues to perform simulated planetary EVA emergencies. These stations are a platform for aerospace medical research investigating the complexities of medical rescue operations in a remote and hostile setting. Several MDRS crew rotations have performed EVA emergency simulations. During these simulations, the ability of crewmembers to act quickly and effectively in emergency medical situations in analogue environments was assessed. General results from these simulations yielded issues concerning medical care provisions, constraints in care due to spacesuits, and time delay during real emergencies. This paper summarizes these EVA emergency simulations, provides recommendations, and identifies future areas of research.",1,2013-09-16,Conference Paper,NA
84878695390,The Mars-500 crew in daily life activities: An ethological study,Tafforin C.,Behavior Adaptation | Human Mars exploration | Interplanetary missions | Isolated and confined environment (ICE) | Time,Acta Astronautica,91,NA,69-76,10.1016/j.actaastro.2013.05.001,"A Mars mission is a new challenge for scientific investigators in the space field. What would be the behavioral profile of an interplanetary crew with long-duration social isolation and spatial restriction? The current study addresses this question with the first ethological data from the Mars-500 experiment. It took place in Moscow, Russia from June 3, 2010 to November 4, 2011. It was designed to simulate the living and working conditions of an isolated and confined crew over 250 days for reaching Mars, 30 days for Mars orbiting with Mars landing and 240 days for returning to Earth. The Mars-500 crew was composed of three Russians, two Europeans and one Chinese. The Mars-500 facilities comprised four hermetically sealed, interconnected modules and a Martian surface module. We applied the ethological method based on observation, description and quantification of the individual and inter-individual behaviors in terms of personal actions, visual interactions, object interactions, body interactions, facial expressions and collateral acts. These events were scored on the Observer XT® software, from video recordings made every two weeks at breakfast time inside the habitat module. We found the following results: a diminishing collective time from the first phase corresponding to the 250-day trip to Mars to the second phase corresponding to the 240-day return to Earth; 35-day cycles then 70-day cycles of high duration of personal actions within these phases; periodic oscillations of duration of inter-personal actions; decreasing then increasing occurrences of facial expressions with temporal points of decrements, around day 159 and day 355, after 6 months and one year of simulation; increasing occurrences of collateral acts over the full 520-day journey. We discuss the findings with regard to a Mars mission scenario. Time has a major impact on the behavioral profile, as shown by indicators of physical and psychological states of fatigue, stress, well being and good spirit. The interplanetary crew follows phasic, cyclic, periodic and punctual behavioral changes in a temporal dynamic as a positive adaptation. © 2013 IAA Published by Elsevier Ltd.

METHODS: Breath tests based on the oral administration of 13C-labeled or hydrogen-producing substrates followed by the detection of their metabolites (13CO2 or H2) in breath were used to measure gastrointestinal motility parameters during the 520-d spaceflight ground simulation within the MARS-500 Project. In particular, the gastric emptying rates of solid and liquid contents were evaluated by 13C-octanoic acid and 13Cacetate breath tests, respectively, whereas the orocecal transit time was assessed by an inulin H2-breath test, which was performed simultaneously with the 13Coctanoic acid breath test. A ready-to-eat, standardized pre-packaged muffin containing 100 mg of 13C-octanoic acid was used in the 13C-octanoic acid breath test to avoid the extemporaneous preparation of solid meals. In addition, a cassette-type lateral flow immunoassay was employed to detect fecal calprotectin, a biomarker of intestinal inflammation. Because no items could be introduced into the simulator during the experiment, all materials and instrumentation required for test performance during the entire mission simulation had to be provided at the beginning of the experiment. RESULTS: The experiments planned during the simulation of a manned flight to Mars could be successfully performed by the crewmembers without any external assistance. No evident alterations (i.e., increasing or decreasing trends) in the gastric emptying rates were detected using the 13C-breath tests during the mission simulation, as the gastric emptying half-times were in the range of those reported for healthy subjects. In contrast to the 13C-breath tests, the results of the inulin H2-breath test were difficult to interpret because of the high variability of the H2 concentration in the breath samples, even within the same subject. This variability suggested that the H2-breath test was strongly affected by external factors, which may have been related to the diet of the crewmembers or to environmental conditions (e.g., the accumulation of hydrogen in the simulator microenvironment). At least in closed microenvironments such as the MARS-500 simulator, 13C-breath tests should therefore be preferred to H2-breath tests. Finally, the fecal calprotectin test showed significant alterations during the mission simulation: All of the crewmembers were negative for the test at the beginning of the simulation but showed various degrees of positivity in at least one of the subsequent tests, thus indicating the onset of an intestinal inflammation. CONCLUSION: Breath tests, especially those 13Cbased, proved suitable for monitoring gastrointestinal motility in the 520-d isolation experiment within MARS-500 project and can be applied in long-term spaceflights. © 2013 Baishideng.

In order to study the impact of high versus low crew autonomy on crewmembers and the crew-mission control interaction, we conducted a series of pilot studies involving three space simulation settings: NASA Extreme Environment Mission Operations (NEEMO) missions, the Haughton-Mars Project, and the pilot phase of the Mars500 Program. As in our previous on-orbit studies on the Mir and International Space Station, crew and mission control subjects working in missions involving these three settings completed a weekly study questionnaire that assessed mood and interpersonal interactions using the Profile of Mood States, the Group Environment Scale, and the Work Environment Scale. The Mars500 pilot study also directly assessed individual and group autonomy. In these studies, high autonomy periods were those where crewmembers planned much of their work schedule, whereas low autonomy periods were those where mission control personnel developed the schedule, much as happens now during actual space flight conditions. Our results suggested that high work autonomy was well-received by the crews, mission goals were accomplished, and there were no adverse effects.During high autonomy periods, crewmembermood was generally reported as being better and creativity was higher, but mission control personnel reported some confusion about their work role. The crewmember group environment in the Mars500 pilot studywas dependent on the nationalitymix.Despite scoring lower in work pressure overall, the four Russian crewmembers reported a greater rise in work pressure from low to high autonomy than the two Europeans. In contrast, the European crewmembers reported a greater rise in dysphoric mood in going fromlow to high autonomy, whereas the Russians’ emotional state remained the same or slightly improved. It is time to study the effects of high autonomy with larger subject samples during actual space missions on-orbit in preparation for future exploratory missions, where high autonomy will be the norm.",2,2013-01-01,Chapter,NA

During 520 days of the experiment, 37 times of data collection were performed, totally over 400 digital images of tongues and facial complexion and over 20, 000 data were collected. These data were then analyzed by a team of TCM, statistics, and data mining experts. Some TCM diagnostic elements and methods applicable to the space environment were established and verified, and characteristics and evolvement of TCM patterns (reflecting physical and mental conditions) of volunteers in long-term closed environment were summarized and elucidated. The main results are as follows: The analysis of tongue, facial complexion and pulse characters, as well as the analysis of pulse-subhealth correlation, can effectively reflect the health condition of the volunteer, indicating that volunteers were indeed in subhealth even though they were not ill; TCM pattern evolvement of various volunteers in long-term closed environment follows some common trends, Qi-deficiency being the thread pattern, with individualistic features depending on constitutional differences (manifested in various degrees of accompanying patterns of liver-qi stagnation, spleen deficiency, damp encumbering or yin deficiency).

The effect is more prominent after long-duration space flights and can persist for several weeks after landing. The objective of this study was to determine the effect of a simulated Mars environment on periodontal status and levels of salivary microorganisms and immunoglobulins in the human oral cavity. Twelve healthy male volunteers were studied before, at 1 and 2 weeks, and after completion of a mission in an isolated, confined simulated Mars environment at the Mars Desert Research Station, USA. We conducted a current stress test, measured salivary immunoglobulin, cortisol, α-amylase, salivary flow rate, and levels of plaque and salivary microbes, and assessed clinical periodontal parameters (probing depth, bleeding on probing, and clinical loss of attachment). Salivary IgG levels and Streptococcus mutans activity were significantly higher at 1 week. Values for clinical periodontal parameters (probing depth, bleeding on probing, and clinical loss of attachment) significantly differed at 1 week. Stress might be caused by the difficulty of the mission rather than the isolated environment, as mission duration was quite short. Periodontal condition might worsen due to poor oral hygiene during the mission. The present findings show that all periodontal conditions and levels of oral bacteria and stress after completion of the simulated Mars mission differed from those at baseline. To verify the relationship between stress status and periodontal health in simulated Mars missions, future studies using larger patient samples and longer follow-up will be required.",3,2013-01-01,Article,NA

DNA samples were isolated from the feces of the participants taken just before the experiment, upon 14, 30, 210, 363 and 510 days of isolation in the experimental module, and two weeks upon completion of the experiment. The taxonomic composition of the microbiome was analyzed by pyrosequencing of 16S rRNA gene fragments. Both the taxonomic and functional gene content of the microbiome of one participant were analyzed by whole metagenome sequencing using the SOLiD technique. Each participant had a specific microbiome that could be assigned to one of three recognized enterotypes. Two participants had enterotype I microbiomes characterized by the prevalence of Bacteroides, while the microbiomes of two others, assigned to type II, were dominated by Prevotella. One participant had a microbiome of mixed type. It was found that (1) changes in the taxonimic composition of the microbiomes occurred in the course of the experiment, but the enterotypes remained the same; (2) significant changes in the compositions of the microbiomes occurred just 14-30 days after the beginning of the experiment, presumably indicating the influence of stress factors in the first stage of the experiment; (3) a tendency toward a reversion of the microbiomes to their initial composition was observed two weeks after the end of the experiment, but complete recovery was not achieved. The metagenomic analysis of the microbiome of one of the participants showed that in spite of variations in the taxonomic compositions of microbiomes, the ""functional"" genetic composition was much more stable for most of the functional gene categories. Probably in the course of the experiment the taxonomic composition of the gut microbiome was adaptively changed to reflect the individual response to the experimental conditions. A new, balanced taxonomic composition of the microbiome was formed to ensure a stable gene content of the community as a whole without negative consequences for the health of the participants. © 2013 Park-media, Ltd.",19,2013-01-01,Article,NA

The FaceReader, commercial software developed by VicarVision and Noldus Information Technology, has been used to extract seven time dependent components of facial expressions from the video records. To interpret the obtained time dependent components of facial expressions we have proposed a mathematical model of emotional stimuli assuming that dynamics of facial expressions is determined by emotional stimuli of different types and intensities and facial expression at the moment of the stimuli.

Today, the increase of population and pollution as well as the global economic instability, makes autonomous production of food and energy a request also for megacities. Settlement in Space has been imagined, almost since the beginning of their perception, green, for survival reasons. Plants produce oxygen and consume C02 while humans the opposite. Therefore there is the need to support each other. Moreover, there is the psychological factor, which applies to both the city and Space. It is important for humans to experience the cycle of life through the cycle of plants. The current research on life support systems is based on the work of microorganisms, vegetables and humans (e.g. MELliSSA) and has many similarities with the systems that are developed for food and energy production in the city. The problems are basically the same, though for Space much more extreme; lack of space, light, air, water, temperature control plus oxygen and lack of gravity. The extreme-design research group has been dealing with the psychophysiological habitability of autonomous habitat in extreme environment since 2007 and from 2009 working in the EuroMoonMars ILEWG campaign in the Mars Desert Research Station simulation facility. This paper addresses similarities and differences between Space and mcgacity applications and proposes the exchange of information and technologies. Building such a system for the city could help experience how it would be to live in a similar system in Space, while we could adapt systems that have been designed for life support in Space on earth applications.

We used computerized content analysis of the crew written messages to calculate the frequencies of utilization of psychologically relevant semantic units. The high autonomy conditions caused significant decrease of crew's needs and requests in written messages, which supposed to be a sign of crew's adaptation to 'autonomous flight'. It was shown that 'key' events of the experiment (e.g., landing on Mars simulation, communication loss, restoration of audio communication, etc.) caused considerable alterations in content of crew's messages to MC. Most of the key events altered crcwmembers' time perception, their emotional state, and their need for communication with 'Earth' and for draining of negative emotions outside. Period of high autonomy with ""no communication"" resulted in subsequent considerable decrease of communication amount. That can testify about temporary impairment of individual communication patterns and styles caused by isolation and high autonomy conditions. ©(2012) by the International Astronautieal Federation.",4,2012-12-01,Conference Paper,NA

MARS-500 provided a unique test platform, because of its setting, where a small crew is isolated for a long duration simulating a manned Mars mission. Thus more prolonged or repeated usage of MECA could be tested. The evaluation focused on core support functions that concern prolonged or repeated usage of MECA. For the MECA experiment, two groups of three astronauts trained and gamed every- other week for thirty minutes (including procedure training and entertainment gaming). The astronauts communicated via chat. MECA collected information on crew condition (social network. Emotional State) and performance (effectiveness and efficiency of operations during training and gaming), and provided (simple) feedback on crew condition and performance. Research questions were: How to record and interpret social, cognitive and affective processes during computer based tasks? How to provide individual and team feedback on these processes? How the crew responds to such ePartner (electronic Partner) actions? The MarsSOO support functions were perceived useful in general, but particular improvements in the content, personalization, usability and attractiveness were needed to establish high performance profits and end-user acceptance. Team-member's inclination to express Emotional State changes differed consistently between the two groups with different cultural and social characteristics. Memory deficiencies differed for the crew members, providing important requirements for MECA support. For better effects on performance, user modeling methods should be applied to tailor the support functions to the individual situated support needs. Providing a free-format text communication tool (like chat) offers major opportunities to collect data on Emotional States and group cohesion. Important lessons learned were: richer content and interactions are needed for long duration, empirical studies of this kind. Lack of a common language brings additional constraints and costs. Constraining or stripping game functionality to control user behavior had a negative effect on user motivation. The prototype and test set-up should induce an adequate level of intrinsic motivation.

Usage of prototypes of onboard LSS on the first ground imitations of the Mars spaceflight is extremely complicated and economically unprofitable. More rational approach is application of the LSS Virtual Simulators of the separate system function incorporated in the uniform Hardware and Software Complex intended for the LSS Crew Service Operation (HSCSOS). First version of the HSCSOS was considered at the 58th 1AC in 2008. In subsequent years, this complex is to provide greater inform-action content has been complicated by increasing the number of the separate Life-Support System Virtual Simulators and the Biomouse Hardware-Engineering Assembly (BHEA) for carrying out of psycho-physiological examinations. HSCSOS is based on the usage of the simulation modeling. Models of LSS functioning in the nominal, off-nominal and emergency conditions were created as well as models of the monitoring of the environmental controlled feature values and the estimation of the crew activity efficiency under the LSS off-nominal and emergency situations (ONS) and its localization.

We applied the ethological method based on observation, description and quantification of the individual and inter-individual behaviors in terms of personal actions, visual interactions, object interactions, body interactions, facial expressions and collateral acts. These events were scored on the Observer XT® software, from video recordings made every two weeks at breakfast time inside the habitat module. We found the following results: a diminishing collective time from the first phase corresponding to the 250-day trip to Mars to the second phase corresponding to the 240-day return to Earth; 35-day cycles then 70-day cycles of high duration of personal actions within these phases; periodic oscillations of duration of visual interactions; increasing occurrences of collateral acts over the full 520-day journey; decreasing then increasing occurrences of facial expressions with temporal points of decrements, around day 159 and day 355, after 6 months and one year of simulation. We discuss the findings with regard to a Mars mission scenario. Time has a major impact on the behavioral profile, as shown by indicators of physical and psychological states of fatigue, stress, well being and good spirit. The interplanetary crew follows phasic, cyclic, periodic and punctual behavioral changes in a temporal dynamic as nominal states of adaptation. ©(2012) by the International Astronautieal Federation.",1,2012-12-01,Conference Paper,NA

Analysis of data that were collected among crew members during seven months of isolation (Van Baarsen, 2011) revealed that the isolation did not have a negative effect on crew motivation and feelings of person autonomy in general. The results indicated that both accurate information given during the training and realistic private expectations have a direct positive effect on autonomous feelings of crew members in that decisions can be taken freely and that participation is voluntary. The study was carried out within the scope of the MARS-500 study which includes a Mars mission simulation of 105 (pilot study) and 520 (main study) days and involves an international crew of 6 men who lived and worked in hermetically sealed modules in the IBMP facilities in Moscow. In the present study, the data that were collected among mission ground control regarding their observations of the well-being, motivation, and person autonomy among the crew, will be analysed and compared to the data of the crew. The data evaluate the Mars experiment by the use of questionnaires among the crew in terms of, i.e., • information received (""My experiences here are in line with what I was told during the selection and instruction procedure""), • perceived social pressure (""I don't feel free to make my own decisions""), and • perceived voluntariness (""I feel independent regarding deciding to participate in this experiment""). It is hypothesized that (1) ratings among ground control regarding crew well-being will be positively related to their ratings of crew voluntariness and freedom of choice, and (2) the higher the ratings of ground control, the higher the ratings among the crew regarding their (a) experiences of voluntariness and freedom of choice, (b) perceived information and expectations consistency, and (c) levels of motivation. The findings will be discussed regarding communication and decision making among crew and mission control in the context of crew well-being, mission safety, and responsibility. Also, moral expectations and ethical considerations regarding future participation in long duration Human missions such as Mars will be discussed. We will make use of descriptive, longitudinal pattern analyses and correlations. The findings may have relevance for communication and decision making in which both crew and mission control have a role.",1,2012-12-01,Conference Paper,NA
84883498564,Approaches to the development of biomedical systems for piloted exploration missions,Grigoriev A.,NA,"Proceedings of the International Astronautical Congress, IAC",1,NA,206-208,NA,"The sine qua non condition for piloted missions to Mars or other objects of the solar system including asteroids is availability of suitable biomedical systems. The design concept should be built with reference to the known factors of such missions, their duration, environment on terrestrial bodies, and time crew will stay there. Many aspects of the biomedical systems developed and realized aboard orbital stations, the International space station in the first place, deserve to be regarded as predecessors of the systems for health monitoring and maintenance of future exploration crews. At the same time, there are issues and tasks which have not been yet fully resolved. Specifically, these are prevention of the adverse changes in body systems and organs due to microgravity, reliable protection from the spectrum of space radiation, and elucidation of possible effects of hypomagnetic environment. We should not walk away from search and development of key biomedical technologies such as a system of automated fitness evaluation and a psychodiagnostic complex for testing and optimization of operator's efficiency, and others. We have to address a large number of issues related to designing composite life support systems with high autonomy, closure and ecological safety of human environment that will provide transformation of all kinds of waste. Another crucial task is to define a concept of the onboard medical center and dataware including the telemedicine technology. All the above developments should assimilate the most recent achievements in physiology, molecular biology, genetics and advanced medical technologies. Biomedical researches on biosatellites do not lose topicality. An important step toward designing and enhancement of biomedical systems for exploration missions was made in the Mars-500 project carried out at the Institute of Biomedical Problems in Moscow. The experiment furnished valuable observations of the relationship within the human-environment system and a wealth of data about health and performance of people living in the conditions of artificial environment and isolation. The experiment reproduced several features of exploration mission including very long duration, autonomy, and work on the Martian surface. It provided an opportunity to test some countcrmeasures to negative health developments, and to verify and upgrade telemedicine technologies, to validate stand-alone systems of psychological support, and numerous technologies and equipment for life support. Also, new data on mechanisms of body adaptation in the course of long-term simulation experiment were acquired. ©(2012) by the International Astronautieal Federation.",0,2012-12-01,Conference Paper,NA

As underlined by the European Cooperation for Space Standardization, the integration of sound human factors into all project phases related to human space mission, starting from the very beginning, has become a primary necessity, in particular considering the approaching scenario of long duration/range missions. As a means for dealing with this need, this work proposes a new conceptual model, which focuses on incorporating human factors principles right from the preliminary design phase into all aspects of long-duration/range human mission projects in order to improve habitability. The new conceptual model developed during five years of doctoral research at TU-Berlin (Schlacht, 2012)', referred to herein as the Integrated Design Process (IDP), incorporates three key design principles: habitability factors, a user-centered approach, and a holistic methodology. The conceptual model was tested against existing models in four separate studies, specifically: a study on Moon Base design at the SSDW 2009; a study to investigate habitability on the Mars Desert Research Station; a study to design space equipment for system operations at the TU-Berlin; and a study to design a closed-loop habitat for long duration missions with the DLR. The results suggest that employing such a model during the design phase of a space mission will improve habitability and usability of the item under development, thus improving user performance, safety, and ultimately mission success. The implications of such a model extend beyond application in space and include other environments where individuals are expected to live and work in confined areas for extended periods of time, such as in research laboratories in Antarctica. It can also be applied in megacities as well as in retirement homes.",0,2012-12-01,Conference Paper,NA

Aims: This study was planned to find the effects of physical and mental workload on taste sensitivity and salivary stress biomarkers. Materials and Methods: Twelve crew members were selected. Taste reactions and intensity of the taste sensations to quinine sulfate, citric acid, and sucrose were tested before and after mental and physical tasks for one hour. Also, psychological mood states by profile of mood state, salivary, salivary alpha amylase and cortisol, and current stress test scores were measured before and after mental and physical tasks. Results: Average time intensity evaluation showed that after the mental and physical tasks, the perceived duration of bitter, sour, and sweet taste sensations was significantly shortened relative to control group. There were good correlations between average time intensity of sweetness, bitterness, sourness and cortisol levels. Conclusions: Taste alterations due to stress can have an effect on the health and confidence of astronauts in long- term space missions.

A first flight of the Parrot was made on sites P2 and P3 on Day09 and the movies were sent by Internet to SALM Sainte-Rose and University of La Reunion for the selection of the preferred areas for sampling. Pictures of selected locations on P3 site were sent back to MDRS by SALM Sainte-Rose. A second flight of the Parrot was made on Day10 to take close-up images of the selected spots and again sent to SALM Sainte-Rose where precise indication of samples was made from film images to study the differences between close-by shaded and exposed areas in two locations. Pictures of selected samples were sent by Internet to MDRS and on Dayl 1, an EVA was succesfully made to retrieve the samples for SALM, with duplicates for VU Amsterdam. Sample analyses were made at a later time at SALM Sainte-Rose, for a final report to MDRS EuroMoonMars Crew 100A Lessons learned from the MDRS simulation were that UAV reconnaissance of terrain can save time and energy of crews by helping to plan the best route for the final sample retrieval EVA and sample selection may be efficiently made by a science team from a distant location.

In the framework of the PolAres program of the Austrian Space Forum, a first test of the Phileas rover prototype was accomplished. Seven scientific and engineering experiments investigated selected aspects of a human exploration mission in an operational environment. Rio Tinto offers an excellent location for Mars analogue simulations. The surface topography as well as the mineralogical similarity to the MER Opportunity landing site at Meridianum Planum, and the aspects of the fine granular and dusty environment provided high fidelity simulation conditions to test operational procedures and candidate instruments for a human Mars mission. The demonstration of the ""Phileas"" rover drivetrain structure and its interaction with the ""Aouda.X"" spacesuit simulator was one focus of the experiments. Additional tests focused on the interaction of the Phileas rover with the Dignity rover and the White Label Space Lander mock-up. During bad lightening conditions at twilight, Dignity and Phileas rovers inspected the lander for ""landing damages"" and give the operators a first impression of the operational challenges of a robotic mission. The results from these experiments could be helpful for future human-robotic interaction strategies. The field crew was supported by a full-scale Mission Control Center (MCC) in Innsbruck, Austria. The field telemetry data was channeled to the MCC to enable a Remote Science Support team to study field data in near-real-time and have the opportunity to influence the flight planning as the mission proceeded.

The aim of study was to research interrelations of a functional intra-group ""leader - slave"" role and level of stress-resistance with dynamics of neuroendocrine status in conditions of long-term confinement. The correlations between neurohumoral regulation and leadership level were found. During confinement, the subjects with higher level of instrumental leadership activity in comparison with others were characterized by higher level of basal metabolism that was accompanied by increased insulin and more intensive exchange of carbohydrates, as well as by lower stress level and probably higher sodium body content. Higher concentration of testosterone in instrumental leaders, as compared with other groups, confirms the role of this male sex hormone which provides the short reaction time, muscular strength and qualitative characteristics of human activity. Ratio of C-peptide, Cortisol and growth hormone testifies about domination of parasympathotonia and vagoinsular mechanisms of neuroendocrine regulation in leaders. That could be realized in their relatively unworried state and more rational energy exchange during personal activity. We compared hormonal parameters of participants according to their stress-resistance level as measured by the capacity to manage own emotional state. Higher concentration of estradiol and neuronspecific enolase (NSE) in blood together with lower concentration of thyroid stimulating hormone (TSH) was found in subjects with higher stress-resistance level in comparison with subjects having lower stress-resistance level. The lowest levels of follicle stimulating hormone, free thyroxine and testosterone were found in subjects with middle stress-resistance level. The significant correlations between stress-resistance level and hormonal concentrations in blood were observed, positive for estradiol and NSE, and negative - for TSH. The received results give a basis to suppose that higher stress-resistance is accompanied, from one hand, by higher activity of biochemical reactions in brain structures, and from the other hand, by higher level of basal metabolism. As a whole, results of research help to understand the realizing mechanisms of patterns of psychophysiological and neurohumoral reactions in subjects with the different hierarchical intra-group status, functional role and level of stress-resistance.",0,2011-12-01,Conference Paper,NA

In 2007, a crew of seven researchers took part in the 100-day ""FMARS-11 Long Duration Mission"" (F-XI LDM) at the Flashline Mars Arctic Research Station (FMARS) on Devon Island, in the Canadian High Arctic. The purpose of F-XI LDM was to gather data for twenty-two scientific investigations while under simulated Mars conditions. Conditions included physical isolation on a remote uninhabited island, and a twenty-minute communications delay. While several studies were related to human factors and psychology, no study on communications between the crew and mission support was formally conducted. However, challenges in crew-support team interactions presented themselves. This paper is aimed at exploring crew interactions with the mission support team to identify qualitative trends from anecdotal observations during and after the mission, data collected from the crew during immediate post-mission interviews and pilot survey data taken four years after the mission,. Results confirm the emergence of the well documented ""Us versus Them"" division that has frequently occurred between groups in isolated confined environments with remote management groups not under the same stressors. A conflict impact survey was developed by soliciting critical events from crew and support members exemplifying incidents where crew and support personnel struggled and grouped into taxonomy of categorical event types. Categories were then formulated into an online survey assessing frequency and impact (both short-term and long-term) on mission goals and crew performance. Preliminary results identified post deployment structural changes in communication protocols, changes to expected resources and support to crew communication problems were perceived as most disruptive by crew. Perceptions of impact were greater for future long duration missions by both crew and support respondents for these categories as well. Methodology for identifying relevant and salient exemplar incidents for inclusion into a more robust taxonomy of critical events will be expanded in near term additional studies. However, even with these challenges the mission was successful and all mission goals were met. Observations presented here may be useful in planning for future long duration planetary analogue missions, and crewed space missions. Copyright ©2011 by the International Astronautical Federation.

Crews alternated between days of no cooking, using only ""instant"" and prepackaged foods, and cooking days during which the main meal and other foods were prepared by crewmembers from shelfstable ingredients. Equipment provided included a breadmaker, stove, oven, sprouting kit, and a small refrigerator/freezer. We assessed crewmembers' mood state, self-reported state of health, food preparation time, and food intake by daily surveys. Crewmembers rated their liking for the foods served at their main meal, and noted their relative intake of each food. They were also invited to comment on the ""high point"" and ""low point"" of each day's experience at the station. Our hypothesis was that crews would prefer custom prepared meals to instant meals despite the burden of preparation time and effort.

Methods: Finger blood pressure and beat-to-beat heart rate were monitored in six male volunteers taking part in a 105-d Mars mission simulation. Data were collected before, during (Days 35-38, 70-72, and 100), and after confinement. Recordings were performed in the sitting position during 5-min spontaneous breathing, 3-min 12 cycle/min breathing, 3-min 6 cycle/min breathing, and 5-min mental task performance. Results: We found significant U-shaped changes across the confinement period in systolic arterial pressure (SAP), diastolic arterial pressure (DAP), and mean arterial pressure (MAP). In the first month of confinement, mental task performance significantly lowered SAP by 34.23 mmHg and MAP by 19.89 mmHg compared to spontaneous breathing, whereas these changes were reversed during other periods. Furthermore, no differences in arterial pressure and heart rate were found between spontaneous, 12 cycle/min, and 6 cycle/min breathing. Conclusions: Our findings are in line with and extend previous findings on the alteration of blood pressure regulation due to longterm confinement. © by the Aerospace Medical Association, Alexandria, VA.",3,2011-01-01,Article,NA

""Mars-500"" is the project, which allows compiling materials about human behaviour in long-term spaceflight, his mental condition and in-flight performance. The project ""Mars-500"" includes a series of experiments simulating many aspects of an inter-planetary manned flight. The main part is a series of experiments on long-term isolation of the crew in conditions of the specially built ground-based experiment facility. Real participation of test subjects in the real system service is extremely complicated and economically unprofitable. More rational approach is the virtual simulator application of separate systems incorporated in the uniform hardware/software complex for crew's service of integrated life support system operation (HSCSO). The basic opportunity and economic feasibility of the HSCSO development and application model are resulted. The structure of virtual simulators, which describe functioning ILSS and parts of an environment interacting with system, is examined. The structure HSCSO includes: virtual simulators of separate systems, the main routine, which simulates changing controllable parameters of a crew's environment, the subroutine forming the mass and energy loads of crew, additional procedures setting and identifying of the probable off-normal situations and estimating efficiency of operator's actions at its localization and the oxygen generation system's training device. Principles of the formation and the formalized descriptions for virtual simulators and parts of an environment, program implementation of the HSCSO, and also data of the experimental verification resulting on a basis of computing tests and operators' work with given software are discussed. Questions of the HSCSO hardware design are also considered. Copyright ©2010 by the International Astronautical Federation. All rights reserved.",0,2010-12-01,Conference Paper,NA

In order to study the impact of high versus low crew autonomy on crewmembers and the crewmission control interaction, we conducted a series of pilot studies involving three space simulation settings: NEEMO missions, the Haughton-Mars Project, and the pilot phase of the Mars 500 Program. As in our previous on-orbit studies on the Mir and International Space Station, crew and mission control subjects working in missions involving these three settings completed a weekly study questionnaire that assessed mood and interpersonal interactions using the Profile of Mood States, the Group Environment Scale, and the Work Environment Scale. The Mars 500 pilot study also directly assessed individual and group autonomy. In these studies, high autonomy periods were those where crewmembers planned much of their work schedule, whereas low autonomy periods were those where mission control personnel developed the schedule, much as happens now during actual space flight conditions. Our results suggested that high work autonomy was well-received by the crews, mission goals were accomplished, and there were no adverse effects. During high autonomy periods, crewmember mood was generally reported as being better and creativity was higher, but mission control personnel reported some confusion about their work role. The crewmember group environment in the Mars 500 pilot study was dependent on the nationality mix. Despite scoring lower in work pressure overall, the four Russian crewmembers reported a greater rise in work pressure from low to high autonomy than the two Europeans. In contrast, the European crewmembers reported a greater rise in dysphoric mood in going from low to high autonomy, whereas the Russians' emotional state remained the same or slightly improved. It is time to study the effects of high autonomy with larger subject samples during actual space missions on-orbit in preparation for future exploratory missions, where high autonomy will be the norm. © 2010 Elsevier Ltd.

Understanding the way humans work in space-exploration analogue environments permits the development and testing of countermeasures for and responses to potential hazardous situations, and can thus help improve mission efficiency and safety. Analogue missions, such as the one described here, have plausible mission constraints and operational scenarios, similar to those that a real Mars crew would experience. Long duration analogue studies, such as those being conducted at the Flashline Mars Arctic Research Station (FMARS) on Devon Island, Canada, offer an opportunity to study mission operations and human factors in a semi-realistic environment, and contribute to the design of missions to explore the Moon and Mars. The FMARS XI Long Duration Mission (F-XI LDM) was, at four months, the longest designed analogue Mars mission conducted to date, and thus provides a unique insight into human factors issues for long-duration space exploration. Here, we describe the six human factors studies that took place during F-XI LDM, and give a summary of their results, where available. We also present a meta-study, which examined the impact of the human-factors research itself on crew schedule and workload. Based on this experience, we offer some lessons learnt: some aspects (perceived risk and crew motivation, for example) of analogue missions must be realistic for study results to be valid; human factors studies are time-consuming, and should be fully integrated into crew schedules; and crew-ground communication and collaboration under long-term exploration conditions can present serious challenges. © 2010 Elsevier Ltd.

Team members completed questionnaires on stress, coping, and mood on five occasions throughout the mission. Descriptive analyses indicated differences between individual coping styles across time as well as differences in how the genders coped. Stress increased for males while decreasing for females. Males consistently used more avoidant coping while females utilized task coping and social emotional coping. Males also demonstrated higher levels of excitement, tiredness, and loneliness.

This article is a feasibility and design study of a launch vehicle whose mission is to shuttle crew and cargo from Low Mars Orbit to a colony on the Martian surface. A single-stage reusable rocket has been selected to fulfil this mission, code-named Charon. The mission profile of such a vehicle was created, leading to a Maximum Growth Allowance (MGA) Delta-V budget of 6.2 km/s. With the mission profile in mind, each subsystem underwent a preliminary design. With reliability and maintainability in mind, subsystems were designed for redundancy and modularity, and an abort system was included for an added level of safety. The iterative design process resulted in a vehicle with a MGA mass of 198.7 tons, capable of transporting 1200 kg of cargo and a crew of 6 people to a 500 km orbit and back. The preliminary design of the vehicle is deemed safe. Following a fault tree analysis, the Single Launch Loss of Mission, Vehicle and Crew (SL-LOM, SL-LOV, SL-LOC) probabilities are computed to be of 0.975%, 0.12%, and 0.079%. Finally, from the vehicle’s constraints on the base, the feasibility of the project has been reflected upon.

We use safety controls as ways of preventing a system from entering or remaining in a hazardous or accident state. We develop a safety control option space for the habitat, from which designers can select the set of safety controls that best meet resilience, performance, and other system goals.

As the research about Mars exploration and habitation has become popular, several trials have been conducted to build habitats or agricultural space on Mars. However, transporting construction machines and materials from Earth to Mars is limited because of the spaceship's limited space. Moving materials needed to construct architectural structures from Mars to Earth requires lots of space and weight in the spacecraft. Current research suggests building space using 3D printing construction, which needs a heavy extra-large scale 3D printer. As a solution to this problem, we propose the novel design system - 'tensegami' which combines tensegrity and origami as a fundamental unit of agricultural structures. Tensegami uses rods as tension part and membrane components as compression parts. One agricultural space consists of multiple tensegami unit geometries.",0,2021-01-01,Conference Paper,NA

A new reusable quick opening mechanism which can be opened in millisecond is designed to meet the testing requirement of ground simulator for extremely rapid decompression, and the testing results show that the quick opening mechanism can be opened within 0.1 s. The mathematical formulation is also developed, and the comparisons with the results from the literature demonstrate its validity. The CFD simulation and the verification system are established for the airflow in the rapid decompression process under different opening degrees. The simulation results show that the effect of the opening on the decompression process is very obvious and the decompression time corresponding to 50%, 75%, and 100% opening is 479.1 ms, 320.7 ms, and 290.1 ms, respectively.

Eventually they’ll need a way to get around. This paper describes the conceptual design and analysis of a manned10 Mars airplane configured for exploration, research, cargo transport, photography, and the linking of multiple settlements. Design development is being done by an international team of volunteers based on the configuration concept developed by lead author Dr. Daniel P. Raymer and incorporating rocket propulsion concepts suggested by James French. A two-man vehicle was developed based on overall requirements similar to the capabilities of the classic “Jeep” of WWII fame, namely a crew of two plus cargo to a total of 500 lbs, carried at least 260 nmi. It is assumed that the flight control system will be capable of fully autonomous operation when desired and that when carrying humans, they need not be trained pilots. VTOL operation is assumed due to the deplorable lack of paved runways on Mars. Results to date indicate that, with sufficiently advanced technologies, such a manned Mars airplane should be feasible. The configuration presented herein seems viable (“existence proof”) and has certain desirable features but future trade studies may find an even better design.",0,2021-01-01,Conference Paper,NA

The implementation of these novel materials results in higher protection and safety for astronauts, and longer missions in the perspective of lunar bases establishment and manned exploration of Mars. The present study aims to experimentally and numerically characterize an intrinsic self-healing supramolecular polymer that is potentially applicable to space suits, habitats and inflatable structures in general. A dedicated test device has been developed to evaluate the sealing performance of the material through flow rate measurements after a puncture event. The experimental part is followed by the study of the material's constitutive relations including hyperelastic and viscoelastic responses. The related model parameters are computed and calibrated through optimization and data matching tools in order to simulate damage and healing events. Results show that the selected supramolecular polymer possesses effective self-healing abilities also under pressurized conditions, demonstrating its applicability to the considered specific fields in the space sector. Furthermore, for what concerns the analyzed puncture experiments and field of solicitation, the developed model can follow the relaxation process related to the self-healing behavior, since it can predict whether the material is effectively able or not to flow and repair.",3,2020-12-01,Article,Agenzia Spaziale Italiana

The Moon provides the perfect training ground for building large scale bases that one may apply to other planets like Mars. The existence of a radio quiet zone on the lunar far side has promise for early universe studies and exoplanet searches, while the near side provides a stable base that may be used to observe low frequency emissions from Earth’s magnetosphere that may help gauge its response to incoming space weather. The construction of a large-scale radio array would provide large scientific returns as well as acting as a test of humanity’s ability to build structures on other planets. This work focuses on simulating the response of small to large-scale radio arrays on the Moon consisting of hundreds or thousands of antennas. The response of the array is dependent on the structure of the emission along with the configuration and sensitivity of the array. A set of locations are selected for the simulated radio receivers, using Digital Elevation Models from the Lunar Orbiter Laser Altimeter instrument on Lunar Reconnaissance Orbiter to characterize the elevation of the receiver locations. A custom Common Astronomy Software Applications code is described and used to process the data from the simulated receivers, aligning the lunar and sky coordinate frames using SPICE to ensure the proper projections are used for imaging. This simulation framework is useful for iterating array design for imaging any given scientific target in a small field of view.

Engineers developing future spacecraft or planetary surface habitats can benefit from detailed knowledge of a broad range of possible materials that could provide improved protection to space crews from the deleterious effects of prolonged exposure to the space radiation environment. As one step towards providing this knowledge base, we have developed an empirical weighted figure of merit, referred to as shielding effectiveness, that quantifies the ability of a candidate material to shield space crews from the space radiation environment. The shielding effectiveness, as formulated in this study, accounts for the competing physical aspects of target and projectile fragmentation to provide a comprehensive assessment of radiation protection with regard to passive shielding for space applications. The empirical data used in determining shielding effectiveness was obtained from proton and heavy ion accelerator-based experiments wherein Al2O3:C optically stimulated luminescence dosimeter and CR-39 plastic nuclear track detector were irradiated behind candidate space radiation shielding materials of varying composition and depth. As a test case, the experimental setup was exposed to nominal beams of 1 GeV protons, and 1 GeV/n28Si and 56Fe heavy ions, the latter serving as a sample of the high linear energy transfer portion of the galactic cosmic ray spectrum. Established radiation dosimetry techniques were used to obtain linear energy transfer spectra, absorbed dose, and dose equivalent as a function of depth. Based on the measurement results, a shielding effectiveness value was computed, quantifying the efficacy of the candidate material as a function of depth, with cumulative weighting factors accounting for the measured percent composition of baryonic matter in the galactic cosmic ray spectrum, and the measured percent contribution to absorbed dose and dose equivalent. The methodology for shielding effectiveness was tested using the common materials of aluminum, copper, graphite, and water, with polyethylene serving as the standard reference. The preliminary shielding effectiveness values for these materials confirm the low Z principle for effective space radiation shielding, and, furthermore, these values tend to be lower when the effectiveness calculation is based on dose equivalent. Of the common materials studied here, at a bulkhead depth of 5 g/cm2, all materials provide a similar level of radiation protection to within standard error. In addition, this method can be used to supplement and/or verify similar findings obtained from transport models.",2,2020-07-01,Article,National Aeronautics and Space Administration

The focus is generally on near-future scenarios, featuring crewed missions predicated on reasonably realistic technologies. The conclusion from these fictional case studies is that powerful motivations are necessary to mount such missions, such as a search for useful resources (methane, water), or for a refuge of some kind - or for supremely compelling scientific reasons, such as evidence of extraterrestrial life and / or intelligence. Furthermore, for a sustainable mission given modern human factors, necessary enabling technologies may include suspended animation, spin gravity and a propulsion technology such as nuclear, capable of delivering mission times of a few years in length, or less. It may be that, as in Asimov's The Martian Way (1952), such enabling technologies will be a product of an inner Solar System civilisation, thriving before attempts to reach locations like Saturn are ever made, and now capable of stretching existing technologies for the purpose. In which case it may be the children of colonists of space habitats or Mars, perhaps, who might be the first to Saturn, not natives of Earth. But human endeavour is not always logical. In the author's own Titan (1997), in the early twenty-first century a desperate crewed mission is sent to the Saturn system, using contemporary technology, for cultural reasons: to provide a model of scientific aspiration in a post-truth era.",0,2020-04-01,Conference Paper,NA

The designs considered are composed of modules based on published contractor concepts proposed for the lunar Gateway through NASA's NextSTEP program. Using these Gateway concepts as a starting point for the design of a Mars Transit Habitat has potential advantages. Both Gateway and Mars Transit Habitats will have similar requirements for long-term operations in deep space, autonomous and remote operations when the crew is not onboard, and similar requirements for transferring crew to and from a planetary surface - the Moon and Mars respectively. The contractor designs for Gateway were traded against a monolithic transit habitat previously proposed by NASA's Mars Integration Group. In addition, these concepts were considered for a 'shakedown' mission for the transit habitat hardware in cislunar space to build confidence in new systems, including the advanced environmental control and life support systems needed for Mars missions. The results presented include overall vehicle configurations, mass, and volume estimates for the selected design concepts.

Similarly, upcoming decisions in NASA's Artemis program and other Moon / Mars programs will likely influence the development of human spaceflight capabilities for subsequent decades. Given this, we argue that space systems architects require a new approach suitable for tradespace exploration across decades, and we have developed a new metric and tools to illustrate this approach. Typical tradespace exploration approaches trade off metrics for cost and benefit. The main families of metrics are monetary, utility and physical. Unfortunately, dollar, mass or utility metrics are fraught with weak assumptions when applied to decades-long timelines and to space settlements that will benefit from reusable rockets and in-situ resource utilization. Past work by the authors had proposed a new physics-based cost metric suitable for multi-decade architectures termed Lifetime Embodied Energy. Here, we propose a new benefit metric which may be of interest to diverse stakeholders and suitable for the comparison of alternative long-lived architectures: the Sustainable Long-term Growth Rate (SLGR). The SLGR has two components, a sustainability test to be defined by the architect and an average growth rate for key internal and external Figures of Merit (FOM). We show the application of the SLGR metric to a (future) long-term Mars base campaign using only Apollo-derived notional elements without ISRU, and to a case of a human settlement on Mars using future in-situ resource utilization technologies. The key FOM in both scenarios are habitable volume, stock of life support equipment and stock of consumables, as well as their derivative, which is carrying capacity of humans. We use a System Dynamics model to simulate the long-term growth, decline and stability behaviors of these FOM variables under each design option. For this model, we defined the SLGR's sustainability test as avoidance of collapse, meaning that the key FOM's per capita must remain above predefined dynamic thresholds at all times within the multi-decade model horizon. Architectures which collapse are deemed potentially fragile and discarded. For the remaining, potentially robust architectures, the growth rate of each of the key FOM across the multi-decade model horizon is its SLGR. We conclude with an assessment of SLGR compared to other metrics, a discussion of potential pros and cons, and a framing of the SLGR methodology in terms of pathfinding as opposed to traditional tradespace exploration.",0,2020-03-01,Conference Paper,NA

This will involve a significant amount of work prior to the first inhabitants actually travelling to Mars. Most current concepts involve humans building and setting up the in-situ research station when they arrive, although the parts may have been sent separately. This presents a certain amount of risk if equipment is partially damaged or does not fit correctly when assembled. We present a concept that utilises multiple smaller versions of current rover technology with a much more open and flexible design to overcome some of these issues. Current interplanetary rovers are designed to complete specific scientific objectives, and although there are some features purely for engineering use (such as the HazCams), most of the rover is taken up with scientific instruments that cannot be removed or changed. The concept that we present utilises a system of standardised tools that can be removed or changed depending on the current task. This means that these rovers can be used specifically for engineering, and can be used to take a reading of a local area such as temperature, wind, ground stability, use this information to choose optimal sites for habitats, and then build facilities prior to the arrival of human inhabitants. These rovers can then continue to be used, and easily retrofitted with different science or engineering instruments to complete different tasks such as farming Martian land and maintenance of instruments not inside the habitat such as solar panel cleaning. As these rovers are slightly smaller than most civil engineering equipment (there will be multiple units) and do not need expensive and costly one-off instruments, we see this as being a cheaper method to set up a Martian base.",0,2020-02-01,Conference Paper,NA

However, regenerable ECLSS subsystems have required continuous monitoring and frequent maintenance and repair. For the International Space Station (ISS), ground control monitors these subsystems and directs maintenance and repair operations using replacement components and assemblies sent from Earth via resupply. While this has been sustainable for the ISS, habitats for crewed Moon and Mars missions will need to be less dependent on Earth, requiring the ECLSS to be more self-sustaining. For “self-awareness”, the ECLSS will be expected to detect and diagnose component and system health in real time. To do so, the possible failure modes of each ECLSS subsystem and their effects on operability and performance, habitability and crew health must be known. This then informs the data that must be collected via instruments and sensors, and then synthesized for meaningful projections of ECLSS health. A prior study has identified the common failure modes of ECLSS within each subsystem and created a framework for implementing self-awareness into the ECLSS architecture. Additionally, the study revealed the poor reliability of current ECLSS health monitoring system, often times failing to detect a fault or lacking information to analyze its health. Therefore, the next step for self-awareness is identifying what sensory information are necessary to monitor and predict ECLSS health, especially for common failure modes. This paper first summarizes the on-going study on ECLSS failures and the benefit of implementing self-awareness based on the Failure Modes and Effects Analysis. It will specifically focus on the sensory technologies that are currently implemented in the International Space Station ECLSS subsystems and will discuss their limitations. The paper will then suggest sensory information needed for ECLSS self-awareness and the possible means to detect common failure modes.

Elements such as the ESPRIT module and the International Habitat (I-HAB) module are foreseen to be designed and built by European partners. The structure for HALO will be built by Thales Alenia Space in Turin, Italy. HALO and I-HAB represent habitat modules with crew functions. Gateway in itself presents a unique opportunity to apply lessons learned from previous space stations within the given constraints. These constraints are partly due to the location of Gateway, a challenging timeline, limited budget and available launchers. This Paper discusses the commonalities and differences between designing a space station in LEO and a lunar orbital platform such as Gateway, and their implications on overall configuration and interior organisation. Factors like distance and radiation exposure, in connection with resulting cost drivers like the (re)development of suitable transport vehicles and other essential hardware, have major impacts on mission duration as well as on the amount of available habitable space that can be provided. At the same time, requirements regarding human factors remain the same, regardless of mission goals or application areas, leading to a range of necessary measures concerning interior layout and spatial organisation. Thus the evaluation of overall development progress of space station design in general must be set into relation to the according particular mission goal, which is the subject of this paper.

Isolation is an element which strongly affects human behavior, interpersonal relationships, mood and cognitive performances. It may create stress and social conflict, which, because of the isolation, need to be managed mostly independently. Specifically in Space the independence and reliability of the astronauts is fundamental for the overall survival of the crew. Isolation may perhaps be cultural, forced, voluntary, dimensional, temporal, and environmental; however isolation in Space is one of the most extreme forms that have ever been experienced by humans. In this paper the intent is to compare the different factors (such as Proxemics) which characterize different modes of isolation as a source for future foresight and problem solving in the Space context, such as future Moon and Mars settlements and spin off applications. For instance, one focus of interest is on the Proxemics: the ""Science of proximity"" proposed in the 1960s by Edward T.

Such activities are called analogue missions being the facility, the environmental conditions and the crew's life-style analogous to that anticipated on Mars or on the Moon. Yet, there are no formal guidelines or rules for running an analogue mission. Researchers and space enthusiasts can make various decisions while respecting local rules of the safety of the facility. So, missions differ in (i) mission design, (ii) execution and (iii) management. Such context (i)-(iii) leads to inter- and intra-variability between missions. Indeed, the advantage of simulating a large variety of possible future scenarios impacts the quality of scientific outcomes as long as decisions will be made on personal will. The lack of formal guidelines, valid internationally, impacts research leading to possible dramatic long-term implications for incoming crewed missions. In medical sciences, outcomes of human studies are hard to compare between missions as the context (i)-(iii) is unstructured. This work proposes a classification of analogue missions be used as a reference when designing a mission. Here, a mission is identified based on the level of fidelity (low, medium or high-fidelity) and the class (class I, II and III). Fidelity refers to specific dangers that can become a threat to human life (such as lack of resupplies or level of oxygen), while class refers to the duration of a mission. By doing so, it is possible to target key human factors of the adaptation to confinement and isolation in extreme environments. Hence, the mission design becomes a tool itself for revealing or containing operational stressors (like mental workout and decision-making process). The significance of this work lays on increasing the scientific values of analogue missions, starting by addressing the design of the same. In such a way, corresponding guidelines on execution can be easily set.

The paper will discuss the stowage philosophy applied to all baseline variants of the Common Habitat and will discuss the approaches taken to domain-specific stowage, bulk stowage, and fluid and gas stowage. Water and air stowage for the closed loop ECLS subsystem is described across the four variants. Stowage of other supplies, consumables, and equipment is also described across the four variants and based on logistics sizing studies, a self-contained mission endurance is predicted for each variant – e.g. how long a mission each can support without a docked logistics module. Finally, follow-on assessments, including a habitability virtual reality evaluation, are discussed along with specific stowage issues relevant to these assessments.",0,2020-01-01,Conference Paper,National Aeronautics and Space Administration

The Gateway Lunar Orbiting Platform is a modular spacecraft built for cis-lunar orbit and offers a true deep space environment for gaining experience for human missions to Mars. The mission concept for Gateway involves long uncrewed periods between missions; therefore, Gateway requires increased self-reliance to separate the spacecraft from Earth-bound control and oversight.

Similarly, other mission architecture decisions – particularly involving transportation systems – can influence optimal ECLSS architectures. Loop closure influences requirements for water, oxygen, and other consumables. System maintainability and reliability influences spares mass and risk. System, consumables, and spares mass interact with transportation system architectures, including propellant demands and propulsion element sizing. All these interactions with other systems must be considered when evaluating ECLSS options. Analyses that focus only on maximizing ECLSS loop closure – or minimizing ECLSS mass, or minimizing ECLSS life cycle cost – may lead to sub-optimal or even counterproductive system architecture and investment decisions at the mission level. For example, an ECLSS architecture that minimizes ECLSS life cycle cost but results in excessively high logistics mass could lead to significantly increased transportation system costs or make interplanetary transportation infeasible. Increased loop closure could result in higher development costs and higher mass if system/spares mass increases outweigh consumables reduction. In addition, systems mass and consumables mass are not directly comparable and have different impacts on propellant requirements, as consumables mass changes over the course of the mission. This paper presents an integrated analysis examining the overall impact of different ECLSS and transportation architectures on Earth departure mass for a crewed Mars mission, including the habitat and transportation systems as well as consumables, spares, and propellant. Key observations are discussed, along with opportunities for further sensitivity analysis and model development. Overall, ECLSS development activities must consider their impacts at the mission level, as part of an integrated system, rather than in isolation.",0,2020-01-01,Conference Paper,NA

However, regenerable ECLSS subsystems have required continuous monitoring and frequent maintenance and repair. For the International Space Station (ISS), ground control monitors these subsystems and directs maintenance and repair operations using replacement components and assemblies sent from Earth via resupply. While this has been sustainable for the ISS, habitats for crewed Moon and Mars missions will need to be less dependent on Earth, requiring the ECLSS to detect and diagnose component and system health in real-time (i.e. to be “self-aware”). To do so, understanding the possible failure modes of each ECLSS subsystem and their effects on operability and performance, habitability, and crew health is necessary. This information then informs the data that must be collected via instruments and sensors and then synthesized for meaningful projections of ECLSS health. A previous study identified the common failure modes of ECLSS within each subsystem. Additionally, the study revealed issues with the current ECLSS health monitoring system, which often failed to detect a fault or lacked information needed to determine its health. While failures were mostly considered to be independent events, in reality, many were the outcomes of a chain of events instigated by a common root cause.

In particular, understanding volume requirements for the transit habitat is of significant importance because the volume is a first order driver of the habitat size and mass, and therefore the propulsion and propellant requirements for future Mars missions. Despite this importance, there is significant uncertainty regarding how much habitable volume is required to support the crew on these missions. Prior studies provide valuable background, but their focus has largely been on investigating historical analogs in order to develop parametric sizing formulas. Other research has focused on specific drivers of habitat volume and stressors to the crew. However, there has been limited focus on establishing a comprehensive minimum required habitable volume based on crew activity needs and crew health requirements. This paper will describe a detailed effort to establish the minimum required net habitable volume for a Mars Transit Habitat employing a bottom-up methodology. The process used to establish volumetric requirements involves the definition of a set of specific “crew functions” and the assignment of required volumes to each function. This type of bottom-up approach is the most accurate method to establish required habitat volume and is specifically recommended by the NASA Chief Medical Officer for future space missions. The authors established a taxonomy of crew functions that could be required during a Mars transit. These functions include direct operational activities, such as command and control or system maintenance, habitation activities, such as eating and sleeping, or health maintenance activities, such as exercise and leisure. Health maintenance activities also include “pseudo-activities”, such as psychological wellbeing, that are directly related to habitat volume. The authors then defined required volumes for each defined activity, based on habitat analogs, prior research, and SME input. The potential for various activities to share volumetric space was then evaluated, based on temporal usage, compatibility of tasks, and crew health. Finally, the required minimum net habitable volumes for four crew and six crew Mars Transit Habitats were assessed, including consideration of specific geometrical constraints. Results of this study will be used to evaluate deep space habitat options and help formulate future Mars mission requirements.

Eventually, crippling launch costs will make 2nd generation facilities utilizing extra-terrestrial materials economically attractive. The best location for an orbital materials processing and manufacturing complex (OMPMC) is reported elsewhere and O'Neill's proposed locations of either the L4/L5 libration points or an unspecified HEO confirmed. However, a final choice must await detailed studies using high-fidelity ephemeris models. Nevertheless, economic, power and safety demands point clearly to a location in HEO beyond the protection of Earth's magnetic field and drives orbital settlement beyond LEO.

Previous manned exploration missions of long duration have been resupplied with food, water, and air as required. Manned missions to other planetary bodies will have durations of years with little to no possibility of resupply. Consequently, monitoring and forecasting resource consumption are mission-critical capabilities. The Hawaii Space Exploration Analog and Simulation, a long-duration planetary analog simulation, has recently completed its fifth long-term isolation mission conducted to assess the energy, food, and water needs of a six-person long-term planetary mission. This study presents a novel method for forecasting energy consumption, which incorporates the emotional state of the habitat crew. Gathered data show inhabitants in small environments can be influenced considerably by the actions of a single member. This can result in dramatic changes in consumption that could cause forecasting models to deviate to the point of total failure. Previous work found that inclusion of the daily activities and the psychological states of the crew allows for higher accuracy in long-duration forecasts. Currently, psychological assessments in the form of a Positive and Negative Affect Schedule and a generalized artificial neural modulation method are used to incorporate emotional response into machine learning forecast methods. Using these techniques and developments, a large-scale smart habitat control and forecasting system is proposed that will monitor, control, and forecast HI-SEAS habitat resources for future HI-SEAS missions.

This study focuses on the aerodynamic and longitudinal dynamic stability analysis. The main research questions are as follows: Does a tailless aircraft configuration can be used for Martian aircraft? How to the short period characteristic can be improved by side plates modification? Design/methodology/approach: Because of a conceptual design stage of this Martian aircraft, aerodynamic characterises were computed by the Panukl package by using the potential flow model. The longitudinal dynamic stability was computed by MATLAB code, and the derivatives computed by the SDSA software were used as the input data. Different aircraft configurations have been studied, including different wing’s aerofoils and configurations of the side plate. Findings: This paper presents results of aerodynamic characteristics computations and longitudinal dynamic stability analysis. This paper shows that tailless aircraft configuration has potential to be used as Martian aircraft. Moreover, the study of the impact of side plates’ configurations on the longitudinal dynamic stability is presented. This investigation reveals that the most effective method to improve the short period damping ratio is to change the height of the bottom plate. Practical implications: The presented result might be useful in case of further design of the aircrafts for the Mars mission and designing the aircrafts in a tailless configuration. Social implications: It is considered by the human expedition that Mars is the most probable planet to explore. This paper presents the conceptual study of aircraft which can be used to take the high-resolution pictures of the surface of Mars, which can be crucial to find the right place to establish a potential Martian base.

For two weeks, they stayed confined in a special complex, a so-called analog habitat, where they were isolated from the outside world, including a lack of natural lighting and exterior noises, and lived on particularly adjusted Martian time. The mission followed a strict schedule, involving actual scientific work and activities envisioned as necessary for survival and exploration of the red planet. The main objective was to study the behavior and group dynamics of the crew in conditions recreating colonization of Mars, albeit under some unique circumstances compared to previous similar experiments. What was also special about the mission was the use of sociometric methods utilizing custom pervasive sensing solutions that we had built and deployed to complement classic methods based on self-reports and interviews. Based on that experiment, in this paper we contribute twofold. First, we share our deployment experiences to highlight the potential of pervasive distributed sensing systems in sociometric studies of habitat-based missions. The examples presented to this end include quantitative results that we obtained, among others, on social interactions between the astronauts, the impact of atypical situations on the crew, and the ergonomics of the habitat. Second, drawing from the experiences, in cooperation with the astronauts we attempt to highlight some unique challenges that space habitats pose for distributed support systems, such as ours.

In addition to low Earth orbit space stations there have been studies performed for lunar surface outposts, deep space transit vehicles, Mars surface outposts, Phobos or Deimos outposts, and even a Venus skyship. NASA is currently committed to the lunar surface, Mars surface, and deep space transport. Unfortunately, instabilities in US space policy have caused NASA to change focus repeatedly between these three architectures since the 1970s. Further, it can be shown that developing lunar, Martian, and transit habitats in series will require inordinately long periods of time, resulting in exorbitant program expenses. A mitigation to these challenges would be to develop a Common Habitat for transit operations as well as surface operations in both lunar and Martian environments. The Skylab II concept is one means by which a Common Habitat can be developed. Derived from the Space Launch System core stage's liquid oxygen tank, the habitat's pressure vessel is manufactured on the same production line as the SLS. As a Common Habitat, it provides functionality required for both microgravity transit and surface operations. It is currently an open trade as to whether it is more effective to configure the habitat interior with a horizontal or vertical orientation. The horizontal configuration divides the interior into decks running perpendicular to the circular cross section. The vertical configuration divides the interior into decks running parallel to the circular cross section, with two of those decks occupying the upper and lower domes. This paper will describe recent work completed for both the horizontal and vertical configurations. Several unknowns and challenges remain to be resolved regarding whether subsystems can be designed such that a single design can operate in microgravity as well as lunar and Martian gravity. Additionally, given the large size of the habitat, several challenges must be overcome to integrate the habitat with lunar or Martian landers and if the habitat is to be offloaded and repositioned a mechanism must exist to make this possible. Additionally, a means to dock pressurized rovers and resupply logistics modules must be developed. This paper describes open challenges and current options related to these unknowns and challenges. Finally, this paper considers the sensitivity of the habitat to variations in crew size. While Mars studies in the 1980s and 90s often considered crew sizes of six, the Constellation program and subsequent NASA work has focused on a crew size of four. This paper will discuss potential under-utilizations that may result from a four-person crew and mitigations provided by an eight-person crew.",3,2019-03-01,Conference Paper,NA

There are many recent studies on how this could be achieved in an evolvable and affordable manner. Most architectures begin with crewed missions to Phobos or Mars orbit in the mid-2030's, progress toward short-stay missions on the surface, and then culminate with regular, long-stay missions at a permanent outpost in the 2040's. A common factor of these architectures is that many robotic launches would be required in order to support the crew by prepositioning mission elements and other needed supplies. In this paper, the use of 150 kW reusable Solar Electric Propulsion (SEP) tugs as a means to deliver elements both to orbit and the surface is studied. The conceptual SEP tugs make use of continued technology developments that were initialized through the Asteroid Redirect Robotic Mission (ARRM). They would also be used to deliver food and supplies to sustain the crews similar to resupply missions for the International Space Station. These SEP tugs would cycle (with loitering) between staging orbits in cislunar space and Mars orbit. The concepts presented here focus on the use of SEP for purposes of delivering cargo, and could potentially be complimentary to many human Mars architectures presented in the literature. In order to characterize mission design parameters such as dates, masses, and durations, thousands of optimized trajectories were run using low-thrust optimization software. Solutions are found for all launch/arrival date pairs for the years 2038–2053. They can be displayed as contour plots called Bacon plots – the SEP equivalent of porkchop plots. Possible mission architecture concepts for a steady-state human presence on Mars along with the cargo missions needed to keep it functioning are described and the relevant mission parameters such as launch dates, masses, arrival dates, etc., are given.

The challenge asks teams to design and construct a scaled and simulated Martian habitat using indigenous materials and large scale 3D automated printing systems. Phase 1 of the competition, held in 2015, was an architectural design competition for habitat concepts that could be 3D printed.

This paper will discuss the Phase 3 competition, focusing on technology outcomes that can potentially be infused into both terrestrial and planetary construction applications. The Phase 3 competition was divided into two sub-competitions: 1) virtual construction, where teams created a high fidelity building information model (BIM) of their 3D-printed habitat design and 2) the construction competition, which required teams to 3D print a structural foundation and subject materials samples to freeze/thaw testing and impact testing (level 1), produce a habitat element and complete a hydrostatic test (level 2), and additively manufacture a 1:3 scale habitat onsite in a head to head competition at Caterpillar, inc.'s Edwards Demonstration & Learning Center near Peoria, Illinois over the course of three days (level 3). While the Phase 2 competition focused primarily on the development of novel feedstocks and robotic printing systems, Phase 3 emphasized the scale-up of these systems and autonomous operation (demonstrating the capability to operate systems on precursor missions prior to the arrival of crew, or terrestrially in field operation settings where human tending of a manufacturing system may be limited). The Phase 3 virtual construction levels yielded a number of novel habitat designs, including both modular habitats and vertically-oriented habitat concepts. The Phase 3 construction competition also challenged teams to autonomously place penetrations and interfacing elements in additively manufactured structures. The paper will emphasize potential applications for the new materials and technologies developed under the umbrella of the competition within NASA's portfolio and in Earth-based applications such as disaster response and infrastructure improvement.",3,2019-01-01,Conference Paper,National Aeronautics and Space Administration

Additive construction technology is used to autonomously construct a core shell structure which can then accommodate a variety of outfitting needs depending on mission goals and location. Described is an autonomous robotic excavation and construction sequence, coupled with construction printing technology using in-situ materials, with “crewmember-in-the-loop” outfitting processes for a 3D printed habitat, designed for NASA's Centennial Challenge competition for a 3D-Printed Habitat on Mars. Our HexHab design takes its cue from nature and relies on the simplicity and versatility of its geometric shape to provide a hexagonal form factor as a core shell to accommodate a variety of mission objectives for interior outfitting. The design is grounded in functionality and safety with a robust shell thickness for a radiation protective shelter for human habitation on distant worlds. To maximize internal volume, HexHab begins with a hexagonal footprint intersected with a dome to provide three levels of habitable volume and floor area. It is designed and outfitted for a crew of four to live and work comfortably for up to one year before crew replacement or rotation of consumables. Multiple ingress/egress access points and connection locations for rovers or addition of other modules are provided. The core shell is autonomously constructed prior to crew arrival, while the outfitting phase of inserting secondary structures involves a human and robotic partnership for completion of the habitat. Transport of large bulk outfitting items is robotic and crew assisted upon arrival of a construction outfitting crew. Our build process is graphically laid out around the site plan. Depicted are regolith, atmosphere and water processing to create our regolith and polyethylene feedstock. Feedstock mixing, piping to the printer, and HexHab site excavation, printing and outfitting are described.

It has been developed to characterize the deep interior structure of Mars, including the thickness and structure of the crust, the composition and structure of the mantle, and the size of the core. It accommodates two independent, 3 axis seismometers: an ultra-sensitive Very Broad Band (VBB) oblique seismometer and a miniature, Short Period (SP) seismometer. Both seismometers, and their respective signal preamplifier stages, are mounted on a common structure which can be precisely leveled thanks to 3 tunable length legs. This assembly is called the Sensor Assembly. It is isolated from weather by a thermal blanket and WTS (Wind and Thermal Shield) and connected by a flexible cable tether to the E-box, a set of electronic cards located inside the Lander thermal enclosure. INSIGHT was launched from Vandenberg Air Force Base on May 05th 2018, and landed on Mars on Nov 26th 2018, on Elysium Planitia. After a first checkout and some characterization of the seismic signal on the deck of the lander, SEIS Sensor Assembly was deployed on the ground of Mars, thanks to the lander's arm, on Dec 19th 2018. The WTS was deployed on Feb 2nd 2019. After the deployment period of time, during which SEIS already gathered a large amount of data, the commissioning started and the instrument could be finely tuned and characterized. All the subsystems are perfectly working and the behaviour of the instrument is above expectations. The events seen so far by SEIS (dust devils, quakes…) have already allowed the scientists to give their first assessment of the Martian subsurface.",0,2019-01-01,Conference Paper,Jet Propulsion Laboratory
85079179497,Interior configuration concepts for the gateway Ihab,Waclavicek R.,NA,"Proceedings of the International Astronautical Congress, IAC",2019-October,NA,NA,NA,"GATEWAY is planned as an international lunar-orbit space station providing a staging and technology development base for exploring the moon, Mars and other parts of the solar system. Elements such as the International Habitat (IHAB) module are foreseen to be designed and built by European partners. The European Space Agency (ESA) issued invitations to tender for the conceptual design phases for these GATEWAY elements. This paper focuses on the architectural aspects, the design and integration of crew systems for I-HAB within given constraints. As part of a Phase A/B study for ESA, two European industry consortia are working on two extensive parallel concept studies for I-HAB to prove the feasibility (Phase A) and develop the preliminary element definition (Phase B). One team has come together under the lead of Airbus, comprising Thales Alenia Space, Sener, Quinetiq, Space Applications Services, Crisa and LIQUIFER Systems Group to advance NASA's I-HAB layouts towards a design definition. The I-HAB will provide four astronauts for up to 30 days with life support, exercise facilities for crew health, science research facilities and stowage. Based on a preliminary set of requirements for the interior architecture, detailed 3D models depicting possible internal configurations have been developed and trade-offs conducted. The models allow designers to understand how the various internal elements such as crew quarters, sleeping and personal hygiene facilities, exercise devices, science research containers, airlock hatches and stowage bags can best be accommodated in I-HAB. Such models are necessary inputs for performing volumetric and spatial configuration trade-off assessments for the various elements. The paper will discuss the design process and I-HAB configuration options that led to the final design requirements and recommendations. Main design considerations are directed towards private and common spaces such as work, exercise and leisure areas. Within an overall interior volume of <50m3 all these different programmatic functions need to be incorporated. Some of the facilities offer deployability and transformability to increase the possibilities for spatial usage and still allow the multiple pathways necessary to transition from one module to another. The I-HAB studies are considered as vital input for the European Ministerial meetings at the end of 2019 to define the next budget allocation for GATEWAY for the coming years.",0,2019-01-01,Conference Paper,NA

However, ISS has not been as suitable for research on other hazards of human spaceflight such as isolation and communications delay. NASA recently completed a special assessment of whether modifications could be made to operations or facilities so that ISS could be used more effectively as an analog to simulate long-duration crew missions beyond low earth orbit. A cross-disciplinar y team1 met to identify concept of operations, trade spaces, challenges, and opportunities to making ISS more operationally relevant as a Mars transit mission analog, and the results and implementation plans are summarized in this manuscript. In addition to the use case of 12-month missions (already in planning by the NASA ISS Program to bound expected Mars transit durations), three new use cases where ISS could provide valuable high-fidelity experience were identified. (1) Testing of operations procedures and medical care could be enhanced by demonstrating crew handling a simulated medical event in microgravity, autonomously, and with significant communications delay. (2) Isolation and confinement effects of deep space transit could be studied on ISS to validate current habitable volume requirements for Mars transit as well as provide context for evaluating the results of the extensive ground-based simulations in HERA and NEK. A trade study of possible operational and hardware changes that would make ISS applicable to these use cases was completed. (3) Surface operations after the physiological deconditioning of a long transit could be conducted to validate crew ability to perform critical ground tasks after 6-month Mars transit and aid in conceptual design of Mars surface element architectures. Each of the case studies includes a trade space between operational impacts on nominal ISS activities and degree of fidelity. A phased approach to implementation means that several “quick start” activities can be done in 2019-2020 at the same time as planning continues for more complex exploration analog options beginning as early as 2022. The team determined that many of these quick-start tasks could be done with available assets, entirely independent of other exploration system development timelines (such as Orion, Space Launch System). The consideration of the full suite of human spaceflight capabilities in the lunar vicinity can also be included as each step in human exploration serves as a simulation opportunity for some aspect of subsequent missions. Further discussions of options with the international community are critical for considering the benefits as well as impacts of simulation activities on ISS, as well as to better formulate future mission architectures.",4,2019-01-01,Conference Paper,NA

Lockheed Martin is working closely with NASA, the international aerospace community, and other aerospace companies to help develop an optimal architecture for supporting humans at the Moon. Lockheed Martin is the prime contractor for Orion and has been developing concepts for the Gateway along with concepts and technologies for the Human Landing System (HLS) under contract to NASA. The Gateway will be positioned in the vicinity of the Moon to serve as the key piece of infrastructure that enables reusable Lunar landers and sustainable exploration of any location on the Lunar surface. As a Commercial Lunar Payload Services (CLPS) program provider, Lockheed Martin is ready to deliver Lunar science and commercial payloads to the Moon. Deep-space human exploration requires a unique set of advanced, flight-proven systems, with the crew and vehicle operating in autonomy. NASA has announced an HLS architecture and is planning Lunar sortie missions from the Gateway, transporting astronauts to the Moon's surface by 2024. This paper will describe a proposed early mission campaign for crewed landings, including those objectives focused on science, exploration, and technology development. Beyond the major contributions of the crewed landing missions, a Lunar infrastructure comprised of CLPS, Orion, SLS, Gateway, HLS, and various logistics vehicles opens a whole new set of opportunities for secondary science, commercial payloads, and exploration for expansion into deep space. Last year, Lockheed Martin presented a reusable, single-stage lander design, an initial concept for delivering humans to the Lunar surface and a precursor to the Mars Base Camp Mars Ascent/Descent Vehicle. This year, a multi-stage Lunar lander concept will be described, one that leverages both Lockheed Martin's human-certified spacecraft and our deep-space vehicle design, development, and operations experience. Those investments in Orion and interplanetary spacecraft will drive significant reductions in the cost, complexity, and development timeline associated with new crewed vehicles.

85079162591,The value of art as an urban intervention for extraterrestrial settlements and its impact on the subconscious perception of time and space,Lipinska M.,Architecture | Landmark | Perception | Settlement | Urban development,"Proceedings of the International Astronautical Congress, IAC",2019-October,NA,NA,NA,"Throughout the years and centuries, our civilization has been driven by the imperative for development and discovery of the unknown. We can see its manifestations when analyzing the character of urban tissue around the world and the way it is constructed. Urban tissue is in a way a representation of human needs and processes driving us for construction, spreading and growing in a particular way. Some of the elements might differ depending on cultural or climatic conditions but vigilant observation permits us to define those that are omnipresent and repetitive regardless of any variables. One of them is a landmark. Arches, towers, pyramids, totems, obelisks, and even sculptures do not only have a decorative function in the city but more importantly, they highlight something significant and characteristic for its times. Now, facing the new chapter of human space exploration and building settlements on the Moon or Mars, while having a completely blank field for development, we can better understand our history, learn from it and set the base for further actions and project in completely new conditions. This paper, supported by our proposal - The Lunar Exploration Arch - aims to visualize raised subject matter, underlines how analyzing the character of the elements spottable in our surrounding, together with reasons for their existence in general, can serve for designing qualitative and agreeable habitats. It discusses the importance of those components for a better understanding of our own well-being, both on Earth and beyond its borders, where new societies will be forming. This paper analyses landmarks and their impact on humans' subconscious perception of time and space and presents the psychological connection between their presence and being able to identify oneself with their environment. With this work, we aim to explain why an understanding of urban elements and patterns is crucial for any urban creation of our future settlements in a brand new, extraterrestrial way.",0,2019-01-01,Conference Paper,NA
85079152391,Policy research considerations for the selection and use of analogs,Shepanek M.,NA,"Proceedings of the International Astronautical Congress, IAC",2019-October,NA,NA,NA,"NASA human space missions focus on the development of space transportation systems, space stations, Lunar and Mars landings and outposts. While the International space station is currently the most important laboratory and analog for long duration space missions, the high cost and limited access for doing research in space requires the use of ground based analogs. A wide range of variables need to be considered from fidelity to repeatability in the most realistically isolated and confined environment (ICE) available to address critical, specific, research considerations. The Problem: Space flight is an extremely, expensive, high risk endeavor with a broad range of unknown risks to human health and survival. Only a small number of individuals have been in space, for comparatively short periods of time, providing only limited data on the effects of space flight on human health and performance across the human life span. The evolution of space related medical knowledge has identified three major areas of concern: radiation, microgravity, and isolation and confinement. Each of these areas has direct effects on human beings on the molecular, cellular, organ, and overall human system level. Initial information in the 1960s and 1970s was focused on human endurance during the “space race” between the former Soviet Union and the United States. Fundamental and focused research was engaged more broadly starting in the 1980s during the Space lab and Space Shuttle era. Observational data was highlighted through the 1990s during the Shuttle Mir era. Space applied research has been continuously increased since 2000, culminating in long duration human research for about 1 year including “omics” studies, e.g. the twins research in the current ISS era. Highly trained individuals compete for the opportunity to be placed in a very confined space, launched under high G to a physically isolated canister built out of several tubes with a total volume of approximately a lecture hall. They are isolated from family and friends, asked to work long hours with other trained professional colleagues, while undergoing only partially understood physiological impacts of radiation and microgravity for weeks or month or even a year at a time. On orbit, spaceflight changes occur in their brain, sensory, neuro-sensory, neuro-motor, cardio-vascular, endocrine, and musculoskeletal systems. Some of these changes are adaptive in microgravity and return to preflight levels on return to Earth, and some do not return to normal levels. Some of the changes are not adaptive to space flight and again, may or may not return to preflight levels upon returning to Earth. On a systems level, many of these changes may affect behavior and performance of the astronauts during their missions as well as after their return to Earth. NASA's Office of the Chief Health and Medical Officer, Health and Medical Technical Authority and NASA medical operations provides clinical support for human space flight and establishes the standards and research requirements to enable and advance human space flight. NASAs Human Exploration and Operations Mission Directorate funds the Human Research Program (HRP) at the Johnson Space Center. The HRP has developed a critical path roadmap, identifying specific areas of research needed to enable spaceflight missions. Together NASA medical and research efforts are engaging to enable human space flight, currently focusing on bringing the first woman and next man to the moon in 2024 and then for human missions to Mars. The Solution: Toward that end, additional research is needed to buy down the risk of human missions. One way to gather additional data is to use analogs, simulations and testbeds to gather information. Several key factors need to be considered: • Fidelity: The ability to reproduce, to the maximum extent possible, the characteristics of the external and internal environment experienced by humans on a space mission. • Accessibility: The ability to reach the environment in which the testing is to be done. • Repeatability: The ability to access the analog over an extended period of time. • Affordability: The ability to leverage available funds to engage in data gathering. • Leverage: The ability to provide Earth based benefits to government, industry and/or the scientific community from these activities. Currently the best analog for a long duration, long distance space mission to the moon and Mars is the International Space Station (ISS). In turn, the best analog for setting up and staging a mission to Mars and back, will be the lunar missions. And, in each case, there will only be limited data to address the three major challenges to human space flight. More research is needed to buy down risk. Ethical considerations preclude consciously exposing humans to the effects of radiation or microgravity for the sake of scientific research. Though data is available from those exposed through regular employment (radiation workers), exposure during warfare (Hiroshima and Nagasaki), or ethically vetted research on non-humans. While data on bone and muscle loss are available from patients with a variety of medical challenges and some, properly vetted and ethically reviewed, bed rest studies. The third major challenge of human space missions, isolation and confinement, can be studied with substantial fidelity, accessibility, repeatability, affordability and leverage with ground based analogs on Earth. Currently the most remote, harsh, extreme environment on Earth, for which there is international collaboration, scientific access and substantial data already gathered, is Antarctica. The Application: NASA has had a history of working in Antarctica since the Apollo era, from testing Lunar Excursion Module technology to more modern studies of nutrition, plant growth chambers, changes in endocrine systems, individual and small group dynamics mood and countermeasures to individual stress. NASA has worked extensively with national and international partners throughout the history of the space program. Examples include collaborating with the European Space Agency in the Concordia station, the Australian Antarctic Division at its small, extremely isolated Casey, Davis and Mawson stations, as well as a host of other programs. A range of research continues today with Australia and other Scientific Committee on Antarctic Research (SCAR) treaty nations, many of which have small outposts, with limited winter over teams of less than 10 individuals, with little or no capacity to fly in or out during the austral winter. Currently, NASA is working extensively with the National Science Foundation (NSF) on a range of scientific and technology efforts. The NSF is the US Agency representing US interests under the International Scientific Treaty governing access to the Antarctic. NSF and NASA have been cooperating in the deployment of research and clinical training in this ICE environment. A formal agreement provides the opportunity to address critical scientific and operations challenges outside of the laboratory environment, in a dangerous extreme environment in which lives have been lost as recently as this past year. The agreement between NSF and NASA allows both Agencies to collaborate on research in the extreme environment of Antarctica to the benefit of those in the Antarctic and space. Currently research is being conducted in individual and small group dynamics. If agreed upon by both agencies, addition work could include nutrition, remote medical care, communications studies, and a range of advanced technology test bed activities. Conclusions: Substantial benefits are available through the study of Isolated and Confined Environments. Analog research will immediately benefit those working and living in analog environments such as Antarctica. This will substantially benefit not only space mission success, but will improve the lives for a range of populations on Earth.",0,2019-01-01,Conference Paper,NA

We propose a new approach based on a mathematical model of the required payload mass per year that has to be sent to Mars to sustain the life of the settlers during the long period of development of the colony that precedes the self-sufficiency capability. As the required mass is highly dependent on the available working time of the settlers, it is suggested to transform the mass estimation problem into the estimation of the annual missing time to produce all objects needed for the daily life of the settlers. The annual missing time is calculated using five parameters. The first is the number of settlers. The second is the working time capacity per person. The third is an estimate of the total time per person and per year that is required to produce all objects needed for a single person. The fourth is called the sharing factor and is a function of the number of settlers. The fifth parameter allows the conversion of the annual missing time into an annual mass of payload.",2,2019-01-01,Conference Paper,NA

85079141739,Extending the current NASA Mars human exploration architecture to include Titan,White D.,NA,"Proceedings of the International Astronautical Congress, IAC",2019-October,NA,NA,NA,"This paper describes the interim results of an independent study to investigate the human exploration of Titan using one of the Mars exploration concepts described in the NASA Mars Design Reference Architecture document. The authors aim to show that the scientific and political return on investment for human exploration of Mars can be greatly extended by also using the same basic design for Titan exploration. This is enabled primarily by the local availability of resources on Titan such as a significant nitrogen atmosphere, surface water ice and liquid methane. Titan is uniquely suited to allow for self-sufficient habitation by human explorers, possibly for the long term. The study assumes that there is an undetermined but finite level of public support and resources available in the United States for solar system exploration and that only one major human exploration mission campaign past the moon will be funded in the next 50 years. This study discusses how and why Titan should be included as part of the upfront non-recurring expenditure for the development of that Mars human exploration mission. The major conclusions of the study are: • Including Titan in the requirements definition for the Mars electric propulsion and deep space habitat stages increase the total return on investment for Mars exploration. • The data yield per unit time and per unit cost for human exploration of Titan is superior to that of robot exploration due to the travel time and reduced NRE from using the Mars exploration hardware. • The unit recurring cost of the Mars EP and deep space habitat stages could be reduced by as much as 20% due to reduction in piece part cost by allowing for larger lot buys and labour efficiencies due to continuous production as the quantities for Mars exploration are doubled for the combined Mars and Titan plan. • The conclusions listed assume that human missions to Titan are long term, i.e. “one-way” for the initial crew. The authors have aimed to show that the human exploration of Titan using the Mars exploration architecture allows for a unique opportunity to greatly increase our understanding of Titan in a shorter time than could be afforded by robotic exploration. Human exploration of Titan likely provides significant political and cultural benefits as the public imagination and support for a permanent human outpost in the outer solar system will likely be high.",0,2019-01-01,Conference Paper,NA

Sustaining life in outer space and on other planets, where Earth resources are not available, presents unique challenges. Life Support Systems (LSS) are designed to provide humans with everything they need to survive (food, oxygen, water, …), and dispose of their byproducts (CO2, perspiration, feces, …). The simplest form of LSS is based on storage, resupply of all consumables to the crew, and disposal of wastes, without recycling. On the opposite, Bioregenerative Life Support Systems (BLSS) aim at re-creating a virtual “closed” ecosystem, like on Earth, involving plants and animals to grow food, and bacteria to recycle wastes, closing the loop of recycling as much as possible, reducing the needs of resupply from Earth. This paper first presents the situations where a bioregenerative system is desirable in space exploration scenarios. It is then described how technologies developed for improving the closure level of BLSS can aid attaining sustainable development goals for Earth, and how they can help addressing challenging environmental and societal problems in Europe and the rest of the world. The Martian environment features unique opportunities for In-Situ Resource Utilization (ISRU), in synergy with bioregenerative processes. It is discussed how opting for solutions at limited closure level can actually have benefits for a Mars settlement, while maintaining or even improving the benefits of technology transfers to Earth. A design for a BLSS sustaining a crew of 6 based on current and near-future technologies is described, highlighting the challenges faced by such architecture. In particular, the issues of crop lighting, habitat construction, and pressurization, are discussed. Stemming from these challenges, we propose a roadmap of technologies to be developed for building a sustainable Mars habitat. Technologies needed for building a sustainable Mars settlement are put in perspective with nearer-term objectives of Lunar exploration. Starting to build surface habitats and BLSS on the Moon could provide experience on designing and operating several relevant components, with the goal of risk mitigation and cost reduction. It is also shown how these first steps would benefit nearer-term exploration of the Moon, by simplifying mission architectures and allow for the development of a sustainable space architecture.",0,2019-01-01,Conference Paper,NA

The team has researched and designed a functional, expandable monitoring system with its testing currently underway for a full-scale prototype. The system supports one or more cameras and combines images from multiple cameras to capture each side and angle of the region with relative precision. Defined regions and parameters to be monitored have set limits, called thresholds, relative to the ideal or close to the ideal parameter being monitored. Additionally, the system allows automatic thresholding to pinpoint the exact level where faults occur to provide the ability to directly jump to failures and assess them effectively. To offer a centralized system, it records and stores all the data collected via cameras, sensors and satellites at the Supervisory Control Centre, which the authorized personnel can access at any point of time.

A station in deep space will require structures with large surfaces, very high volume to mass ratio and high-packing efficiency. The transportation of bulky payloads to beyond low-earth orbits pose formidable cost and logistical challenges. This requires a paradigm shift in research towards methods to build and assemble low-mass, large and complex structures in space instead of transporting them from Earth and deploying them on-site. On-site additive construction and assembly methods hold promise, but they face a major challenge of still having to transport large and heavy robotic equipment required to perform complex construction. This paper presents an alternate and more feasible pathway in developing small structural units that can be quickly shaped and assembled with limited external support. Inflatable structures hold that promise as they are low-mass, can be quickly reshaped, inflated and rigidized into desired modular units that are assembled into large, complex structures. Our present work extends the inflatables concept to study modular, inflatable blocks assembled into pre-determined geometries. The inflatable building blocks would be assembled into communication relays, science instrument antennas, structures to hold solar panels and large reflectors. Our efforts aim to identify common desired structural design traits in these modular units to enable them to be multi-functional building blocks that can be assembled into more complex functional blocks. Our design methodology focuses on simplicity of deployment mechanisms and high-scalability over varying sizes. Finally, this paper will provide preliminary feasibility of the modular inflatable building block concept and analyze the applications of this technology towards assembly of large structures in deep space.",4,2018-06-25,Conference Paper,NA
85049838628,Resilient architecture pathways to establish and operate a pioneering base on Mars,Potter R.,NA,IEEE Aerospace Conference Proceedings,2018-March,NA,1-18,10.1109/AERO.2018.8396506,"We outline an architecture pathway to establish a permanent base on Mars that can support a 50-person crew. After base establishment, a long-term colony is formed with a gradual reduction in support and supplies from Earth. A steady cadence of missions is used to validate new technologies, build capabilities, reduce risks, and minimize costs. The missions prior to 2050 include assembly of an interplanetary vehicle in lunar vicinity, a deep space mission, a Mars orbital mission, and two Mars surface missions. We also examine the logistics associated with the base's growth in personnel, capability, and operations to the year 2100. Using a human exploration cost tool developed at Purdue, we find a peak yearly spending of $14.9 billion in 2030 with an average cost of $11.8 billion per year until 2050 and $8.2 billion per year after 2050. Assuming a starting budget of $9 billion per year (2016 NASA human spaceflight budget), an 8.8% increase per year from 2018 to 2024 would be required to meet the peak yearly costs. Unfortunately, such an increase is unlikely given NASA's relatively flat inflation-adjusted budget over the past 20 years. In addition, while commercial launch vehicle costs are dropping due to the emergence of reusable launch vehicles (e.g. SpaceX's Falcon 9), hardware costs are yet to reduce within NASA and their contractors, which suggests one or more of the following scenarios: 1) NASA must change how program costs are managed, 2) the publicized timeline for humans landing on Mars must slip, or 3) a new Mars architecture paradigm must be found.",4,2018-06-25,Conference Paper,NA

Several methods have been proposed for constructing a landing pad but so far none are adequate. Local rocks were chosen as the in situ construction material due to the rocks being abundantly available in many locations.

Habitat Marte works in the Nucleus of Research in Engineering, Science and Sustainability of the Semi-Arid - NUPECS located in the city of CaiÃ§ara do Rio do Vento, Rio Grande do Norte State, Brazil. The Mars simulation missions had been performed in 48 hours during weekends in the first year, consisting of Intravehicular-IVA and Extravehicular-EVA activities. Habitat Marte is the first Mars-like station to operate in South America. The Autonomous Module of Sustainable Cooling - MARS is a Portable Life Support System. The helmet is an important component that must present characteristics such as: allow adequate breathing; cooling; avoid the fogg effect in the transparent display. The methodology of this research executed the various activities of production of the helmet prototype to support the Extravehicular Activities - EVAs in Habitat Marte. The helmet was developed in Laboratory of Applied Technologies to Mars and Semi-Arid-MarsLab, based in Universidade Federal do Rio Grande do Norte-UFRN during 2017. As part of the methodology, all helmet development activities were documented, considering design, materials testing, construction, comfort, safety and recycling. In December 2017, the helmet was evaluated during Mission 1 on Habitat Marte. At the end of the EVAs, users were asked about various aspects related to the helmet. The main aspects evaluated were: design; comfort of shoulders and neck; feeling of safety; ergonomics; Weight; the operation of EVA with the equipment. Concepts were assigned from 1 to 5, according to Likert scale. The best-evaluated aspects were: helmet design and weight. Also was considered important: the comfort of the neck. The weaker aspects were the experience in walking and the safety provided by the helmet in the EVA. The helmet features a cooling characteristic, from the connection with the Cooling Module. There is an opportunity for improve the technology applied to the spacesuit equipment.

Positioned in the vicinity of the Moon, the Gateway allows astronauts to demonstrate operations beyond Low Earth Orbit for months at a time. The Gateway is evolvable, flexible, modular, and is a precursor and mission demonstrator directly on the path to Mars. Mars Base Camp is Lockheed Martin's vision for sending humans to Mars. Operations from an orbital base camp will build on a strong foundation of today's technologies and emphasize scientific exploration as mission cornerstones. Key aspects of Mars Base Camp include utilizing liquid oxygen and hydrogen as the basis for a nascent water-based economy and the development of a reusable lander/ascent vehicle. At the core of Mars Base Camp is Orion, a highly capable vehicle with unique features designed for deep space environments and to keep crew members safe. The investments made in Orion can be leveraged to reduce the cost, complexity and development timeline for new crewed vehicles. The Gateway and Mars Base Camp can be designed to utilize the redundancy, performance, and safety built into Orion. Lockheed Martin has a long history of designing, building, and operating planetary landers from Viking to this year's InSight. A mission to study Mars' interior structure, InSight will answer key questions about the early formation of rocky planets. Given the current directives to enable long term deep space exploration, lunar exploration systems including landers should not be point solutions solely for the Moon. Just as the International Space Station is preparing us for long duration human spaceflight, lunar activities can prepare us for Mars. This paper will discuss the overall architecture for lunar exploration missions using precursor versions of the elements of the Mars Base Camp architecture. This includes the conceptual design, concept of operations, Orion derived systems, propulsion system trades, and the potential for a direct tie to Mars entry, descent and landing for a crewed lunar lander.",8,2018-01-01,Conference Paper,NA

Nowadays, missions are more demanding, challenging the robots to perform complex tasks such as drilling and 3D additive manufacturing. The ultimate goal is expanding the human civilization to other planets in our solar system, these settlements will be staring either on the Moon or Mars to fulfil various goals such as astronomical observations, interplanetary spacecraft missions, space colonies and space industrial development. Acheving the goal of human settlement requires tele-operated robotic equipment to be transported to the other plants surface and to utilize the advantage of Lunar in-situ resourcing and on-site manufacturing. This research is investigating a breakthrough robot design optimized through Artificial Intelligent (AI), latest material science findings, and the pioneering capabilities for additive composite manufacturing. This shall be a well-designed robot with the capabilities to construct both simple and complex architectural forms utilizing the in-situ resourcing on the Moon while surviving the extreme Lunar environmental conditions. 3D additive composite manufacturing has the ability to optimize the structure of the robot, reducing its mass while increasing its stiffness. Furthermore, this new technique of manufacturing has the ability to mix different needed materials in one structural entity, which increases the efficiency when compared with conventional layering technique.

It will allow for a characterization of the deep interior structure of Mars, including the thickness and structure of the crust, the composition and structure of the mantle, and the size of the core. It accommodates two independent, 3 axis seismometers: an ultra-sensitive Very Broad Band (VBB) oblique seismometer and a miniature, Short Period (SP) seismometer. Both seismometers, and their respective signal preamplifier stages, are mounted on a common structure which can be precisely leveled thanks to 3 tunable length legs. They are isolated from weather by a thermal blanket and WTS (Wind and Thermal Shield) and connected by a flexible cable tether to the E-box, a set of electronic cards located inside the Lander's thermal enclosure. In order to reach the required level of performances, the 3 VBBs are accommodated inside a vacuum container. Unfortunately, after the environments tests at instrument level in 2015, one of the container's feedthroughs was found to be leaky, inducing non-conformances on some of the major science requirements. The SEIS instrument could then not be delivered and the INSIGHT launch was reported to 2018. A new development plan had to be conducted and led to a successful delivery of the Flight Model to Lockheed Martin in July 2017. Then, the instrument started the ATLO (Assembly, Test, and Launch Operations) campaign and was first integrated to the INSIGHT lander which reuses extensively the cruise bus and the Entry-Descent and Landing System of PHOENIX, which performed a successful mission on Mars Northern terrains in 2008. This integration was followed by a test campaign where SEIS successfully went through various testing. INSIGHT was then moved to Vandenberg Air Force Base and launched on May 05 th 2018. The landing on Mars is planned on November 26 th 2018. But the EDL (Entry, Descent and Landing) phase will not be over for the instruments when INSIGHT touches the ground on Mars. SEIS and HP 3 (Heat flow and Physical Properties Package) will still have to be deployed on the ground thanks to a motorized arm.

Our team has researched and designed a functional, expandable airlock with assembly and testing currently underway for a full-scale prototype. The airlock is designed to survive in the Martian atmosphere: satisfying the pressure difference of 1 atm as well as temperatures below 173 K. A multilayered metallocene polyethylene (mPE) membrane was selected since it meets all design requirements for flexibility, sealability, and impermeability at these conditions. Physical and analytical prototyping supports the use of this commercially available product. Furthermore, an innovative system of ultra-high-molecular-weight polyethylene (UHMWPE) ropes create a lightweight flexible structure that can safely withstand 1 atm of gauge pressure. A door has been designed to distribute roughly 200 kN of force to the frames of the structure while implementing a dynamic seal. Redundancy is integrated through all major systems, including structural layers, airtight seals, and electrical sensors. Electronic airlock systems are controlled by interconnected, off-the-shelf microprocessors and sensors. In total, the expandable airlock weighs 336 kg. Improvements to the design and further areas of development are explored: Optimization of the aluminum frames, door, and base could enable significant reduction of mass in non-critical areas. The dynamic seal should be followed up with reliability testing in expected environmental conditions. Lastly, improved floorboards would ideally fold into a smaller area, and passive actuators would be designed to work at worst-case temperatures without constant heating. Overall, our team's work demonstrates a practical approach to create expandable airlock modules, which could find use on initial human expeditions to Mars.

The moon is seen as a potential proving ground for technologies, equipment and operations, and a venue upon which to learn the art of surface exploration. Mars missions are years in duration with very limited Earth return opportunities, but the moon provides the opportunity to perfect exploration concepts while being only a few days from Earth. Though the environment and gravity differ from Mars, and will thereby not provide a perfectly analogous environment, the remoteness, limited logistics, and harsh conditions on the Moon provide an environment that can be used to stress many systems that will be used or will be extensible to hardware and operations that will be used on Mars. This paper begins by describing the systems, or options for systems, that together comprise a human Mars architecture. With this human Mars operational concept as a basis of comparison, each of these systems is analyzed in the context of a range of potential exploration missions that first targets lunar exploration experience, examining how the lunar experience can be best used to prepare for the eventual human mission to Mars. The paper concludes with a concise summary of specific areas that have the strongest applicability between exploration experience on the lunar surface and extensibility to human Mars exploration.",5,2018-01-01,Conference Paper,NA

On the other hand, these missions require detailed planning and worldwide collaboration, because of the need of extremely high financial resources and technical capabilities. Many researches focused on different aspects of Mars missions are being conducted in these recent years. They include flight preparation, lift-off, interplanetary journey, habitat and Life Support Systems (LSS) design, Extravehicular Activities (EVA), precise landing, planetary exploration, etc. This paper summarizes identified safety issues that can arise during future Mars missions. Based on the analysis of previous studies, where conditions of the interplanetary flight were studied, including environmental issues, Mars habitat and the spacecraft design were discussed and the spacesuit concept was analyzed, the most critical hazards have been defined and the whole mission has been taken into consideration. In particular, possible failures and hazards for the habitat on Mars, space station and spacesuit, including off-nominal situations and their influence on the safety of the astronauts have been investigated. This work is based on the results of previous projects carried out within the Space Generation Advisory Council's (SGAC) Space Safety and Sustainability project group, which aims to bring an international and interdisciplinary vision to this topic and discuss it from different perspectives, creating a foundation for further studies on safety risk assessment.

NASA's new deep space exploration system - the super heavy-lift Space Launch System (SLS), the Orion crew spacecraft and revamped launch facilities at Kennedy Space Center (KSC) - will enable NASA and its commercial and international partners to meet this goal for human exploration of deep space. SLS is the most capable launch vehicle for these efforts, as well as for sending robotic missions deep into the solar system, or even to interstellar space. The vehicle will be available in crew and cargo configurations in progressively more powerful block variants. The initial Block 1 lift capability of at least 26 metric tons (t) to trans-lunar injection (TLI) will be followed by a more powerful Block 1B with the power to loft more than 37 t to TLI. The ultimate Block 2 variant will lift more than 45 t to TLI. For payload accommodation, the Block 1 vehicle can utilize a 5 meter (m) fairing in its cargo configuration with the crew version also able to provide berths for 6U and 12U CubeSats as secondary payloads. The Block 1B crew vehicle will provide as much volume as the space shuttle payload bay in a Universal Stage Adapter (USA) for co-manifested payloads (CPLs). Block 1B cargo vehicles will offer 8.4 m-diameter fairings in 19.1 m and possibly longer lengths, with enough volume to accommodate lunar-orbiting habitat modules and other elements of NASA's Gateway science outpost. For Mars-class payloads, larger fairings for the Block 2 cargo launcher are under consideration. For missions beyond the Earth-Moon system, SLS offers greater characteristic energy (C3) than any other launch vehicle, enabling shorter transit times or heavier payloads with more robust science packages for missions to the outer solar system. Indeed, the unmatched combination of thrust, payload volume and departure energy that SLS provides opens new opportunities for human and robotic exploration of deep space. This paper will provide an overview of the various vehicle block configurations, their capabilities and payload accommodations for sending primary, co-manifested and secondary payloads to deep space.",1,2018-01-01,Conference Paper,NA
85065292814,ESS: A settlement site selection tool for a manned Mars base,Noeker M.,Expert System | Human Space Flight | Mars | Settlement | Site Selection | Solar System Exploration,"Proceedings of the International Astronautical Congress, IAC",2018-October,NA,NA,NA,"In recent years, private entities have joined the race to send humans to the Red Planet. While Mars is well defined as the next frontier for human space flight, little work has been done towards identifying possible settlement sites on its surface. The current site proposals use a bottom-up approach, that is focusing on one settlement site and then investigating if and why this site fulfils all requirements considered relevant to a human outpost. Here, we present the Expert System: Settlement (ESS), a tool that follows the inverse, top-down approach in which initially the entire Martian surface is considered. From there, the set of possible settlement sites is reduced stepwise for various criteria, discarding those sites not fulfilling the specified criteria. Examples of these site requirement are the max. MOLA elevation, the solar power available on the surface, and the water concentration in the subsurface. To cover the different criteria included in our research, the ESS was assembled of the three sub-expert systems Expert System: Engineering Constraints (ESE), Expert System: Climate (ESC), and Expert System: Resources (ESR). The ESS was successfully verified using the engineering constraints defined for the landing site selection of the NASA InSight mission, returning, inter alia, the mission's selected landing site. With view on manned missions, settlement selection constraints were derived from literature to provide input to the ESS. The ESS identified possible settlement sites fulfilling the requirements in Xante Terra/Lunae Planum and West of Elysium Planitia. Other qualifying sites were located in the Northernmost part of Noachis Terra, in Vastitas Borealis between 40Â°N and 50Â°N latitude and in Arcadia Planitia, Northwest of Olympus Mons. The ESS is built completely generic, allowing to run the expert system for a variety of possible and diverse mission architectures. Moreover, the code architecture allows to simply add further selection constraints and corresponding planetary data sets required for future selection processes. The ESS is capable of investigating both landing ellipses (as has been done for the NASA InSight mission) and circular exploration zones around a nominal site. Next to settlement site selection, the code developed is therefore also suitable for landing site selection. With suitable data available, the code can be adapted to any celestial body. The current application of the tool regarding site analysis is directly dependent on the available data sets' coverage and maximum resolution; where the latter controls the computation time of the ESS.",0,2018-01-01,Conference Paper,Canadian Dermatology Foundation

Through the systems engineering approach, students will generate ideas that may or may not make it to the final design development stage, but may potentially be valuable to future real exploration habitats and mission architectures. The final prototype allows an assessment of the focus parameters, which are the vessels’ transformation capacities and layout adaption. The design objective of this project is to examine strategies for commonality between an interplanetary vehicle (IPV) and a Mars surface habitat. The presented design proposals address this challenge to create a common habitation system in both habitats so that crew members will be familiar with the layout, function, and location throughout the expedition. The design tools operate at the intersection of architectural layout design, mechanics, and structural design, and use origami folding techniques and structural form-finding concepts to generate shell action rigidity. In addition, the project develops a strategy for mobility and transformation of the surface habitat prior to its transformed configuration.

Phase 1 of this plan begins in the 2020s, with missions in cislunar space and assembly of the Lunar Orbital Platform-Gateway. The Gateway is an evolvable, flexible, and modular space platform in lunar orbit. It can support crewed missions 30 to 60 days long, with increasing duration each mission. When the Gateway is uncrewed, robotic science missions will be performed. The Gateway allows astronauts to practice the skills and test technologies needed for months and years beyond Low Earth Orbit. A key to success for these deep space missions will be carefully coordinated operations by ground support, flight crew, and autonomous spacecraft. Lockheed Martin Space is designing Gateway concepts as part of NASA’s NextSTEP study contract. Additional operational considerations will be made to accommodate science payloads that would use the Gateway as a communication relay, platform for in-space or remote robotic missions to the lunar surface, and remote experiments during untended periods. The Gateway is modular in design to incorporate international cargo and logistics modules, additional habitat modules, and perhaps crewed lunar landers. These operational considerations are also being designed into the system. Working through the operational practices and relationships between the crew and ground control at the Gateway will provide the groundwork for future missions to Mars requiring more autonomy, such as Mars Base Camp missions. For example, robotic operations on the lunar surface, conducted by scientist astronauts, are directly translated to the exploration of the Martian surface by rovers and Unmanned Aerial Vehicles from a Mars orbital platform.

The phase III competition consists of both virtual and construction subcompetitions. Virtual construction asks teams to render high fidelity architectural models of a habitat and all the accompanying information required for construction of the pressure retaining and load bearing portions of the structure. In construction phase III, teams are asked to scale up their printing systems to produce a 1/3 scale habitat on-site at Caterpillar. The levels of the phase III construction competition (which include printing of a foundation and printing and hydrostatic testing of a habitat element) are discussed. Phase III construction also has an increased focus on autonomy, as these systems are envisioned for robotic precursor missions which would buildup infrastructure prior to the arrival of crew. Results of the phase III competition through July 2017 (which includes virtual construction level 1) are discussed. This Centennial Challenge enables an assessment of the scaleability and efficacy of various processes, material systems, and designs for planetary construction. There are also near-term terrestrial applications, from disaster response to affordable housing and infrastructure refurbishment, for these technologies.",5,2018-01-01,Conference Paper,NA

It featured a first stage heavy lift booster (BFR) and a second stage spacecraft (BFS) to carry passengers to Mars. A second version of BFS would take the form of a specialized tanker to deliver propellants to LEO where it would transfer fuel to the passenger spaceship prior to its transit to Mars. Also in September 2017, Mars Pioneers proposed a third version of BFS: a specialized cargo carrier that would deliver a large, pressurized cargo vessel (module) to Mars. After unloading equipment, the shell of the cargo module would serve as a chemical storage tank to initiate a chemical industry. In the current paper, we propose that a cargo module be converted into a greenhouse to serve the initial Mars base. We provide specifications for an example greenhouse and develop an analysis of its crop production potential. We review current greenhouse technologies and show how selected techniques could be employed in such a facility. We adopt a USDA nutritional standard and analyze two nutritional plans. Then we estimate how many crew could be supported by crop production from the greenhouse while meeting the nutritional standard.",0,2018-01-01,Conference Paper,National Aeronautics and Space Administration
85056166732,Advantages of a modular mars surface habitat approach,Rucker M.A.,NA,2018 AIAA SPACE and Astronautics Forum and Exposition,NA,NA,NA,10.2514/6.2018-5102,"Early crewed Mars mission concepts developed by the National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) assumed a single, large habitat would house six crew members for a 500-day Mars surface stay. At the end of the first mission, all surface equipment—including the habitat—would be abandoned and the process would be repeated at a different Martian landing site. This work was documented in a series of NASA publications culminating with the Mars Design Reference Architecture 5.0. More recent work, dubbed the Evolvable Mars Campaign (EMC), explored whether re-using surface equipment at a single landing site could be more affordable than the Apollo-style explore-abandon-repeat mission cadence. Initial EMC assumptions preserved the single, monolithic habitat—the only difference being a new requirement to reuse the surface habitat for multiple expedition crews. A trade study comparing a single large habitat versus smaller, modular habitats leaned towards the monolithic approach as more mass-efficient. More recent work has focused on the operational aspects of building up Mars surface infrastructure over multiple missions, and has identified compelling advantages of a modular approach that should be considered before making a final decision. This paper explores Mars surface mission operational concepts and integrated system analysis, and presents an argument for the modular habitat approach.",3,2018-01-01,Conference Paper,National Aeronautics and Space Administration
85056153113,Crewed missions to the martian surface via mars base camp,O’Dell S.,NA,2018 AIAA SPACE and Astronautics Forum and Exposition,NA,NA,NA,10.2514/6.2018-5142,"In the summer of 2016, Lockheed Martin presented a proposal for achieving crewed exploration of Martian space as early as the 2028 launch opportunity. Known as “Mars Base Camp,” (MBC) this proposal involved establishing a crewed spacecraft in Martian orbit from which astronauts could perform excursions to the surface of Deimos and Phobos, and could also perform telerobotic exploration of the Martian surface via teleoperated surface rovers and unmanned aerial vehicles. This concept presented a novel, practical, and affordable path to enable human exploration of the Martian system in the next decade, but stopped short of enabling crewed exploration of the surface of Mars itself. This paper proposes a concept of operations and architecture whereby MBC would be utilized as a basis for crewed exploration of the surface of Mars via the addition of a reusable, single stage to orbit, mid Lift/Drag vehicle with vertical takeoff and landing capability called the Mars Ascent/Descent Vehicle (MADV). This paper presents a concept of operations for a follow-on Mars Base Camp mission – MBC-S, in which crewed landings on the Martian surface would first be realized. Concept of operations elements detailed include: operations performed after the first MBC mission to make the MBC elements ready for a follow-on crewed mission, launch and transfer of the MADV to cis-Martian space via the Space Launch System (SLS) and solar electric propulsion, and a concept of operations for short-duration sorties to the Martian surface with MBC as an orbiting base of operations. Major design driving requirements for the MADV are identified, along with a top-level physical and functional architecture. Options for refueling the MADV between sorties are also outlined, including possible opportunities for commercial delivery of propellants to a fuel depot and/or in-situ production of propellants. Concepts of operations wherein the system described herein could also be used for crewed sorties to the Lunar surface are also outlined. Finally, critical next steps and requirements for enabling technologies are identified.",1,2018-01-01,Conference Paper,NA

A Transit Habitat Design Refinement study was conducted from January through March of 2018 that resulted in updates to the operational requirements, design, subsystem details, and the overall launch and operational mass estimates. Coordination with the development of the Gateway as the base for refurbishment operations was included, as were current payload launch requirements on the Space Launch System. The most significant change in this refinement was in the launch operations. In previous transportation architecture studies the Mars transit habitat was launched integrated to a hybrid propulsion stage to form a Deep Space Transport, so some functions could be shared across the habitat and propulsion elements. In this refinement, the habitat is launched separately from the propulsion element to accommodate mass growth options for both elements and multiple propulsion system options. This change added functional requirements to the habitat for free-flying operations including attitude control, rendezvous and docking capabilities with the Gateway, and other exploration elements. This paper provides the results from the refinement study with a new baseline for the Mars transit habitat element.

NASA’s Space Shuttle had a cost of about $1.5 billion to launch 27,500 kg to Low Earth Orbit (LEO), $54,500/kg. SpaceX’s Falcon 9 now advertises a cost of $62 million to launch 22,800 kg to LEO, $2,720/kg. Space launch costs were very high for decades, typically about $20,000/kg, and it was understood that this high launch cost made it necessary for long human missions to recycle water and oxygen to reduce logistics mass. Short missions such as Apollo or Shuttle used stored and resupplied life support materials, but for a much longer mission such as the International Space Station (ISS), recycling saves logistics mass and reduces launch cost. The Life Cycle Cost (LCC) will be computed for resupply logistics and for a recycling system similar to that on the ISS. The LCC includes the costs of development, launch, and operations. The new low launch cost makes open loop life support much cheaper than before. Direct logistics resupply would be less costly than recycling for future human missions, such as a long term moon base, a Mars mission, or a future space station in LEO.",4,2018-01-01,Conference Paper,NA

In this paper, we discuss the uses and insights provided by a relatively new mission design tool, the bacon plot, for Earth to Mars trajectories. The bacon plot is analogous to ballistic porkchop plots but for low-thrust missions and helps to visualize many parameters important to low-thrust missions such as delivered payload, maximum and minimum heliocentric distance, propellant requirements, launch window size, and required times of flight. A design scenario for a Mars SEP orbiter is presented to illustrate how mission designers use bacon plots.

In this work we demonstrate that Martian soil simulant Mars-1a can be directly compressed at ambient into a strong solid without additives, highlighting a possible aspect of complete Martian in-situ resource utilization. Flexural strength of the compact is not only determined by the compaction pressure but also significantly influenced by the lateral boundary condition of processing loading. The compression loading can be applied either quasi-statically or through impact. Nanoparticulate iron oxide (npOx), commonly detected in Martian regolith, is identified as the bonding agent. Gas permeability of compacted samples was measured to be on the order of 10-16 m2, close to that of solid rocks.

It is possible that treadmills may also be part of exercise programs on future Mars missions and that they may be a component of exercise facilities in lunar or Martian habitats. METHODS: In order to determine if the ambient gravity on these destinations will provide osteogenic effects while performing exercise on a treadmill, ground reactions forces (GRFs) were measured on eight subjects (six women and two men) running at 6 mph during parabolic flight in Martian and lunar gravity conditions. RESULTS: On average, stride length increased as gravity decreased. The first and second peaks of the GRFs decreased by 0.156 and 0.196 bodyweights, respectively, per 1/10 g change in ambient gravity.

Lockheed Martin was awarded the contracts for the design, development, test, and production for Orion up through the Exploration Mission 2 (EM-2). Lockheed Martin is also working on defining the cis-lunar Proving Ground mission architecture, in partnership with NASA. In addition, Lockheed Martin is exploring the definition of Mars missions as the horizon goal to provide input to the plans for human exploration of the solar system. This paper describes an architecture to determine the feasibility of a Mars Base Camp architecture within about a decade. This architecture would involve human exploration of both Martian moons, and provide an opportunity for the crew to interact with pre-staged robotic assets on Mars. This study is a high-level assessment to identify architecture drivers and science opportunities. There are several key tenets for this architecture. For this first human interplanetary mission, system redundancy and a self-rescue capability is required. The number of system developments is minimized, and the use of the already developed systems like the Space Launch System and Orion is maximized. To minimize the number of events that could lead to the loss of the whole crew, the architecture does not require rendezvous and docking of pre-staged elements necessary for crew survival during the mission. This paper will describe the different enabling technologies required. The trajectory assumptions will be described, including the results of studies performed for the transit to Mars and return to Earth, in addition to mission design trades for the exploration of the Martian system.

For this reason, the mass and related volume of the MAV cabin drives requirements for Mars Surface In-Situ Resource Utilization generators to manufacture propellants, which: drives the surface power needs, sets the Lander payload size, drives the inspace transportation architecture, and drives the number of launches and time required to land humans on Mars' surface. Some of the architectures currently under consideration in the EMC use a chemical/solar electric propulsion hybrid that inserts into a 5 sol orbit and may require that the crew spend several days in the MAV before a rendezvous with the Mars transit vehicle. There have been no human-in-the-loop (HITL) evaluations to generate the data necessary to inform decisions on the required size of the MAV. These data are critical to begin to close the various EMC architectures. The common cabin concept consists of a core cabin with ECLSS, power, thermal and GNC systems that can be coupled to various mobility systems resulting in use of the core cabin design within a lander cabin, MAV - an in-space taxi between locations in the Mars system, as a Mars moons exploration vehicle, and a Mars surface rover. The common cabin approach could be facilitated through a standard interface design that allows for attachment of the different mobility systems. The interior of the cabin would also be outfitted differently based on the mission of the particular vehicle. The focus of the project summarized here is to determine the size of the smallest viable MAV from a sizing and habitability perspective. Multiple options were considered, two of which were studied in greater depth; one that provides maximum commonality with other cabins needed across the EMC and the other being a unique minimalist cabin. To enable the sizing and habitability assessments, the project completed analysis tasks including generation of functional requirements, development of mission timelines for all phases of MAV operations (from launch to berthing with a transit habitat), definition of required subsystems, computer aided design modeling of potential cabin layouts, and development of preliminary mass equipment lists. A maximum commonality cabin was evaluated with a 4-person crew executing all phases of the mission timeline. Additionally a minimalist cabin design was subjectively evaluated using computer generated models of vehicle layout and design. The results of the test findings and analysis are described in this paper. The results suggested that the volume and mass of the common cabin and the minimalist cabins were nearly identical. The benefits of the common cabin also include the potential use as a habitable airlock/node as part of a Cislunar habitat system, buying down risk and gaining flight experience with this Mars-forward habitation element.",8,2017-06-07,Conference Paper,NA
85021211083,An architecture for sustainable human exploration of mars enabled by water from the lunar poles,Wilcox B.,NA,IEEE Aerospace Conference Proceedings,NA,NA,NA,10.1109/AERO.2017.7943895,"This paper describes an architecture for human exploration of Mars that would be enabled by 10 metric tons (t) per day of ISRU water extracted at the lunar poles. The architecture involves a concept for a standardized ""self-propelled tank"" having an 85% propellant mass fraction that could hold up to 51 t of LH2/LO2 propellant. A variant of this tank would be equipped with landing legs so that, when fully-loaded, it could lift another full tank into Low Lunar Orbit (LLO), release it, and have enough propellant remaining to mate with an empty tank and to land safely back at the ISRU plant in a lunar polar crater. Two such pairs would be launched each lunar sidereal month such that the two payload tanks could mate together in LLO and depart to a carefully-selected High Earth Orbit (HEO). This orbit is such that exactly one tank would be consumed propelling one full tank to HEO and returning one empty tank from HEO to LLO, with both tanks arriving empty. Also, a Low Earth Orbit (LEO) is selected where two full tanks in HEO could mate together such that one full tank arrives in LEO while the other tank has just enough propellant left to return to HEO, arriving empty. This combination of capabilities allows payloads to be launched from Earth into LEO, where they could be ferried to HEO using lunar propellant. Such payloads could be assembled together as stacks in HEO, where an array of full tanks accumulated over time from lunar ISRU could propel them on Hohmann transfers to Mars on every opportunity (every 26 months). The notional payload we envision launching to Mars every 26 months includes two 31 t Deep Space Habitats (DSHs, one for the outbound journey and one for the return journey) plus a 48 t Mars Surface Habitat with Ascent Vehicle (MSHAV). The stack departs HEO with a small burn from the array of 24 standardized propellant tanks - just enough to put it on an Oberth Maneuver trajectory, swinging by the top of the Earth's atmosphere where the main Trans-Mars Injection (TMI) burn occurs, consuming 7.8 of the 24 tanks. No tanks are jettisoned, so as to make this architecture sustainable and affordable. Upon arrival at Mars ∼7-9 months later, another 9.2 tanks are burned to inject the stack into Low Mars Orbit (LMO). Exactly one tank is burned to de-orbit the MSHAV, reducing its velocity to zero at some point deep in the Mars atmosphere. The one tank that de-orbits the Mars entry stack is lost. After ∼500 days on the Mars surface, the MAV launches and mates with the main stack in LMO. The returning DSH and the 23 tanks depart LMO with a burn of 4.3 tanks for Trans-Earth Injection. Upon arrival at Earth, 1.7 tanks are burned to inject into HEO, where the tanks could be shuttled back to the lunar surface for re-fueling. The DSH is mated with a single full tank at HEO that brings it to LEO to rendezvous with a crew capsule for re-entry.",0,2017-06-07,Conference Paper,National Aeronautics and Space Administration

Given the complexity of colonizing a planet, such as Mars, a great deal of research, simulation, and planning is necessary to identify the optimal model for colonization in order to guide future mission architectures. One such model, which has received a significant amount of publicity, is that of the ""Mars One"" organization and its plan to build a colony one piece at a time by sending up small groups of people every 2 years. Although critique of this or any model can focus on a number of predominantly engineering-focused areas, from propulsion technologies to habitat design, the present paper uses a human factors perspective to evaluate the Mars One approach. This critique also presents a more theoretically sound model, the Seed Colony Model (SCM), and, using existing literature, outlines how this approach has advantages for future colonization missions that highlights the human element. Specifically, a variety of potential psychosocial issues for a colonization mission are explored. These include territoriality caused by an individual experiencing ownership of some aspect of their environment, in-group/out-group mentality due to social constructs, conflict escalation, the lack of a ""finish line,"" and self-selection. All issues are examined in the context of a permanent, sustainable colony. Because human space operations have been limited to smaller groups and had the capability to return to Earth in case of medical emergencies, these previous spaceflight missions are not an accurate representation of the social aspects of a Mars colonization mission. To better represent the conditions, the current paper focuses on experiences from Antarctic missions, where larger teams spend a winter-over in that hostile environment with very limited opportunities for re-supply or extraction. Although colonization missions are in the distant future, this paper aims to develop the theory to support the need for human-centric design considerations for these missions. The SCM when employed for mission planning, will provide an over-arching system architecture to improve mission success rates. This model is designed around the interactions and complexities of a team, and individual differences in crewmembers, and injects decades of research in the behavioral sciences into the plan to send humans to live on another planet.",1,2017-06-07,Conference Paper,NA

As part of its development of sustainable human Mars mission concepts achievable in the 2030s, the Evolvable Mars Campaign has identified desired durations and mass/dimensional limits for long duration Mars habitat designs to enable the currently assumed solar electric and chemical transportation architectures. The Advanced Exploration Systems Mars Transit Habitat Refinement Activity brought together habitat subsystem design expertise from across NASA to develop an increased fidelity, consensus design for a transit habitat within these constraints. The resulting design and data (including a mass equipment list) contained in this paper are intended to help teams across the agency and potential commercial, academic, or international partners understand: 1) the current architecture/habitat guidelines and assumptions, 2) performance targets of such a habitat (particularly in mass, volume, and power), 3) the driving technology/capability developments and architectural solutions which are necessary for achieving these targets, and 4) mass reduction opportunities and research/design needs to inform the development of future research and proposals. Data presented includes: an overview of the habitat refinement activity including motivation and process when informative; full documentation of the baseline design guidelines and assumptions; detailed mass and volume breakdowns; a moderately detailed concept of operations; a preliminary interior layout design with rationale; a list of the required capabilities necessary to enable the desired mass; and identification of any worthwhile trades/analyses which could inform future habitat design efforts. As a whole, the data in the paper show that a transit habitat meeting the 43 metric tons launch mass/trans-Mars injection burn limits specified by the Evolvable Mars Campaign is achievable near the desired timeframe with moderate strategic investments including maintainable life support systems, repurposable structures and packaging, and lightweight exercise modalities. It also identifies operational and technological options to reduce this mass to less than 41 metric tons including staging of launch structure/packaging and alternate structural materials.",14,2017-06-07,Conference Paper,NA

Extensive evaluation of the raw regolith simulants was conducted via Optical and Electron Microscopy (SEM), Visible–Near Infrared/Infrared (Vis–NIR/IR) Spectroscopy and thermal characterisation via Thermogravimetric Analysis (TGA) and Differential Scanning Calorimetry (DSC). The analysis results led to the characterisation of key properties of these multi-component ceramic materials with regard to their processability via powder bed fusion 3D printing. The Lunar and Martian simulant regolith analogues demonstrated spectral absorbance values of up to 92% within the Vis–NIR spectra. Thermal analysis demonstrated that these materials respond very differently to laser processing, with a high volatility (30% weight change) for the Martian analogue as opposed to its less volatile Lunar counterpart (<1% weight change). Results also showed a range of multiple thermal occurrences associated with melting, glass transition and crystallisation reactions. The morphological features of the powder particles are identified as contributing to densification limitations for powder bed fusion processing.

With current mission architectures the provision of food for long-duration missions away from Earth requires a significant number of resupply flights. Furthermore, it would be infeasible to provide the crew with continuous access to fresh produce, specifically crops with high water content such as tomatoes and peppers, on account of their limited shelf life. A greenhouse as an integrated part of a planetary surface base would be one solution to solve this challenge for long-duration missions. Astronauts could grow their own fresh fruit and vegetables in-situ to be more independent from supply from Earth. This paper presents the results of the design project for such a greenhouse, which was carried out by DLR and its partners within the framework of the Micro-Ecological Life Support System Alternative (MELiSSA) program. The consortium performed an extensive system analysis followed by a definition of system and subsystem requirements for greenhouse modules. Over 270 requirements were defined in this process. Afterwards the consortium performed an in-depth analysis of illumination strategies, potential growth accommodations and shapes for the external structure. Five different options for the outer shape were investigated, each of them with a set of possible internal configurations. Using the Analytical Hierarchy Process, the different concept options were evaluated and ranked against each other. The design option with the highest ranking was an inflatable outer structure with a rigid inner core, in which the subsystems are mounted. The inflatable shell is wrapped around the core during launch and transit to the lunar surface. The paper provides an overview of the final design, which was further detailed in a concurrent engineering design study. During the study, the subsystem parameters (e.g. mass, power, performance) were calculated and evaluated. The results of the study were further elaborated, leading to a lunar greenhouse concept that fulfils all initial requirements. The greenhouse module has a total cultivation area of more than 650 m2 and provides more than 4100 kg of edible dry mass over the duration of the mission. Based on the study, the consortium also identified technology and knowledge gaps (not part of this paper), which have to be addressed in future projects to make the actual development of such a lunar greenhouse, and permanent settlements for long-term human-tended research tasks on other terrestrial bodies, feasible in the first place.",10,2017-02-01,Article,European Space Agency

The crews that operate, live, and work in these artificial constructions will rely on bio-regenerative closed-loop systems and principles, such as algae reactors and higher plant chambers, in order to minimize resupply needs and improve system resiliency. Greenhouse modules will play a major role in closing not only the oxygen, carbon-dioxide, and water supply loops, but also by providing fresh food for the crew. In early mission scenarios, when the habitat is still in its build-up phase, only small greenhouse systems will be deployed, providing a supplemental food strategy. Small quantities of high water content crops (e.g. lettuce, cucumber, tomato) will be cultivated, improving the crew's diet plan with an add-on option to the pre-packed meals. The research results of a 400-day biomass and crew time simulation of an adapted EDEN ISS Future Exploration Greenhouse are presented. This greenhouse is an experimental cultivation system that will be used in an analogue test mission to Antarctica (2018-2019) to test plant cultivation technologies for space. The Future Exploration Greenhouse is a high-level analogue for cultivation systems of early mission scenarios on Moon/ Mars. Applying a net cultivation area of 11.9 m2, 11 crops have been simulated. Biomass output values were tailored to a tray cultivation (batch) strategy, where 34 trays (0.4x0.6 m) have been integrated into the overall production plan. Detailed work procedures were established for each crop according to its production lifecycle requirements. Seven basic crew time requiring work procedures (e.g. seeding, pruning and training, harvesting, cleaning, post-harvesting) were simulated. Two cultivation principles were the focus of the analysis: The In-Phase Cultivation approach where all trays start at the same time, and the Shifted Cultivation approach, where trays start in a specific sequential manner. Depending on the approach, different biomass output patterns emerged and were analysed with respect to crew consumption, crop shelf-life, and the risk of food spoilage. Crew time estimates were performed with respect to the overall production process, which resulted into 208.9 min per day for the planned cultivation area. When applying normal terrestrial worktimes, this equates to approximately 50% of a crew member day for system operation. Biomass and crew time results were analysed in relation to each other, creating specific productivity factors for each crop type. This way, future mission planning, crop selection, and greenhouse design studies can better tailor the implementation challenges of small greenhouse modules into the habitat infrastructure.",1,2017-02-01,Article,Horizon 2020 Framework Programme

Those complications are related to the confined environment of a spacecraft during the flight and habitats on the moon or Mars surface, crewmembers' personalities, cultural and social differences, and work-related stressors. As a result of crew exposure to all or some of these difficulties, crewmembers may not be able to perform at their best capacity and fulfill their mission requirements. This exploratory paper examines architectural and design strategies that address and potentially alleviate stressors through stimulating crew adaptability to new environments and circumstances. These strategies are analyzed based on following dimensions for adaptive performance: • Self-controlled behavior in emergencies and crisis situations. •Managing work-related stress, especially in critical situations. • Innovative approach to problem solving. • Maintaining productive operations in unpredictable and unknown situations. • Continuing learning and applying new technologies and procedures. • Facilitating social and cultural adaptability. • Displaying adaptability to physical environment and managing it to fit the purpose. The paper aims to analyze these listed dimensions through relevant case studies and to identify any potential opportunities for the development and integration of supportive design strategies to increase adaptability in crewmembers. In a summary, a platform for further inquiry into architectural and design strategies is proposed for more in-depth discussion in the future.",2,2017-01-01,Conference Paper,NA

The concept of a permanent Moon outpost which can provide a demonstration platform for exploration technologies, appears to be paramount to not jeopardize future Mars expeditions. The base can provide an efficient test-bed environment to assess critical technologies to sustain the manned space exploration of the solar system. Since lunar polar areas are potentially rich in volatiles to study and use, the reference scenario for this work has been set onto the lunar south pole. The particular ambient conditions of this region allow for the presence of permanently shadow regions where water ice is supposed to be present and mixed with regolith grains, as suggested by some survey missions. In Situ Resource Utilization (ISRU) techniques can provide most of the consumables needed for the Environmental and Life Support System (ECLSS), such oxygen and water, together with propellants for spacecraft. The purpose of the research here presented is to address the simulation of possible solutions to provide continuous power to the crewed settlement. The solution chosen to generate and regulate electricity, and store energy, is a photovoltaic-hydrogen Stand Alone Power System (SAPS). If abundant water reservoirs will be confirmed, hydrogen could be produced in-situ via electrolysis and used by fuel cells. The required energy for this chemical process and for supplying all the base loads could be supplied by solar panels during sunlight hours. Oxygen and hydrogen are stored in specific tanks and used during eclipse periods. Batteries are also present to absorb power peaks and are charged by the photovoltaic arrays. The SAPS performance has been estimated using a lumped parameter model. Since the outpost location is one of the crucial aspects for all the subsystems, and especially for solar panel positioning, a virtual reality environment has been used to simulate real time shadows. Ephemerides have been used to correct locate the celestial bodies for the chosen timeframe. This paper describes the integration and the results obtained by the different simulation environments and how these can help in the design process of a lunar base, which is part of an incremental architecture strategy towards future manned Martian exploration.",0,2017-01-01,Conference Paper,NA

Crew isolation is also impacted by up to 40 minutes round trip communication delays between Earth and Mars. Today's space habitat designs primarily focus on technological solutions, addressing physiological, psychological, safety, and functional needs of the crew. Higher level needs, related to wellbeing and comfort, are not yet incorporated into point designs. We believe that harmonizing Human Material Interaction (hHMI) within the interiors of a spacecraft is both necessary and essential. In this paper we outline a research effort to analyze, understand and enhance the quality of spatial and temporal Human-Material-Interaction in interiors of long-duration space habitation modules, while aiming to generate a rational understanding of aspects that contribute to the ""wellbeing"" for humans in shared spaces. In this context wellbeing is understood as balancing the physical, the psychological and the emotional states of the crew. This approach is expected to provide the astronauts a quality of life typically reserved for leisure. Any well-designed environment can become a strong influence on what people think and do. Interiors of transportation systems are intersection points for culture, society, technology and the environment. The consequence of harmonizing Human Material Interaction (hHMI) in these spaces has the potential to balance and de-stress the human component in it, thus transforming parts of the commutation time into a time of relaxation, contributing to the general upliftment of the travel experience during space flight. More than addressing the established issues of sustainability, this investigation is human centred. Grounded in a vision of ethical design, we are looking at the potential for design to enhance the qualities of shared realms in flow. An enclosed space in movement is a complex composition of proportions, materials, surfaces, colour, lighting, sounds and smells. How can these elements be arranged in sensitive ways to create a space which positively influences the state of being? The research is an in-depth study of their semantics -indicating symbolic functions and its connection to formal aesthetic aspects. The outcome will lead to guidelines, defining parameters to induce a ""quality-of-life"" experience in the system of human space flight, ranging from months-long cislunar space to years-long interplanetary travel. We are sharing our hHMI research (a work in progress) to advocate for the instrumental change it would make when both designers and users, following the hHMI criteria, humanize the interiors of space habitats.",1,2017-01-01,Conference Paper,NA

Previous manned exploration missions of long duration were resupplied with food, water, and air as required with regular resupplies. Manned missions traveling to other planetary bodies will have duration of years, with little to no possibility of resupply. Consequently, the monitoring and forecasting of resource consumption is a mission critical capability. The Hawaii Space Exploration Analog and Simulation, a long duration planetary analogue simulation, has recently completed its fifth long term isolation mission gathering energy, food, and water demands for six man long term planetary mission. A novel method for forecasting energy consumption will be presented that incorporates the emotional state of the habitat crew. Gathered data show that small environments can be heavily influenced by the actions of a single crew member resulting in dramatic changes in consumption, throwing forecasting models off to the point of total failure. Previous work has shown that the inclusion of the daily astronaut activities and psychological state allow for higher accuracy in forecasting for longer duration. Currently psychological surveys in the form of the Positive and Negative Affect Schedule, and a generalized artificial neural-modulation method are used to incorporate emotional response into machine learning forecast methods. Using these lessons and developments, a large scale smart habitat control and forecasting system will be proposed that will monitor, control, and forecast habitat resources for future manned missions.

Accordingly, knowledge and technology must be improved for the Deep Space (DS) environment. A major focus is posed on a new powerful launch vehicle, able to deliver spacecraft into DS transfer, and a sustainable transportation system to connect Earth with DS infrastructures. The Moon represents one of the most probable intermediate steps along the journey to Mars. The main idea is to develop a DS Habitat in Cislunar environment. This infrastructure will require continuous refurbishment and replenishment using DS transfer vehicles. A candidate for this is an unmanned transfer vehicle, the Lunar Space Tug (LST), able to transfer large amount of logistic cargo from LEO environment to the Cislunar space. Focusing on the LST primary function of transferring a significant amount of cargo, the Propulsion Subsystem represents one of the most critical subsystem involved in the LST design. Two different classes of technologies can provide the required propulsion capabilities. On one side, Chemical Propulsion can provide high thrust levels, guaranteeing short transfer time and high reliability level thanks to its maturity, whereas its low specific impulse leads to large propellant mass requirements. Electric Propulsion, instead, provides higher specific impulse, allowing significant fuel saving, whereas the transfer time might increase considerably, requiring in any case a more challenging mission design in order to optimize the low-thrust trajectories involved. Because the payload to deliver is a nonpriority cargo, the transfer time can be relaxed, gaining in terms of propellant requirement and this design thread leads to consider an Electric Propulsion architecture. This paper presents a possible design of the Propulsion Subsystem of LST. A Hall Thruster cluster has been adopted to fulfil the thrust requirements, considering the whole operational lifetime along a 5-years mission. A mass model approach has been adopted for each of the main critical components of the Propulsion Subsystem. Analogous approach has been adopted for the design of the Attitude Control Subsystem, based on chemical thrusters for the rotational control of the LST, mainly during proximity operations. A trade-off analysis is performed to establish the best cluster architecture with respect to the mission and system requirements and constraints.

NASA and Bradley University in Peoria, Illinois, are holding a new US$ 2.5 million competition to design and build a 3-D printed habitat for deep space exploration, including the agency's journey to Mars. The multi-phase 3-D Printed Habitat Challenge, part of NASA's Centennial Challenges program, is designed to advance the additive construction technology needed to create sustainable housing solutions for Earth and beyond. The first phase of the competition ran through Sept. 27, 2015. This phase, a design competition, called on participants to develop state-of-the-art architectural concepts that take advantage of the unique capabilities 3-D printing offers. The top 3 prizes with a prize purse of $40, 000 were awarded at the 2015 World Maker Faire in New York. The second phase of the competition is called the Structural Member Competition and it was divided into three levels which happened in the spring and summer of 2017. On Earth these same habitat manufacturing capabilities could be used to produce housing wherever affordable housing is needed and access to conventional building materials and skills is limited. Terrestrially, it is envisioned that local indigenous materials (dirt, clay, sand, etc.) could be combined with readily available recyclable materials and used to construct semi-permanent shelters against environmental elements for human habitation. The goal of the 3D-Printed Habitat Challenge is to foster the development of new technologies necessary to additively manufacture a habitat using local indigenous materials with, or without, recyclable materials.

There are many recent studies on how this could be achieved in an evolvable and affordable manner. Most architectures begin with crewed missions to Phobos or Mars orbit in the mid-2030's, progress toward short-stay missions on the surface, and then culminate with regular, long-stay missions at a permanent outpost in the 2040's. A common factor of these architectures is that many robotic launches would be required in order to support the crew by prepositioning mission elements and other needed supplies. In this paper, the use of 150 kW reusable Solar Electric Propulsion (SEP) tugs as a means to deliver elements both to orbit and the surface is studied. The conceptual SEP tugs make use of continued technology developments that were initialized through the Asteroid Redirect Robotic Mission (ARRM). They would also be used to deliver food and supplies to sustain the crews similar to resupply missions for the International Space Station. These SEP tugs would cycle (with loitering) between staging orbits in cislunar space and Mars orbit. In order to characterize mission design parameters such as dates, masses, and durations, thousands of optimized trajectories were run using low-thrust optimization software. Solutions are found for all launch/arrival date pairs for the years 2038-2053. They can be displayed as contour plots called Bacon plots - the SEP equivalent of porkchop plots. Possible mission architecture concepts for a steady-state human presence on Mars along with the cargo missions needed to keep it functioning are described and the relevant mission parameters such as launch dates, masses, arrival dates, etc., are given.

Using cislunar space as a testbed to develop technologies and operational knowledge is a critical stepping stone on the path to Mars. NASA and the international community are developing the next generation of advanced habitation systems which will be tested in cislunar space, allowing astronauts to work in deep space for prolonged periods of time and gain the experience necessary to endure long duration trips to Mars. While the primary objective of the Deep Space Gateway (DSG) is to support the development of deep space habitation technologies and the construction of a Mars transit vehicle, this asset could also be available to support a variety of other missions, including those involving lunar surface operations. The DSG is evolvable, flexible, and modular and can be used in both an uncrewed and a crewed mode. There are several classes of cislunar orbits and the mission type will dictate the desired orbit required for the portal. Equipped with solar electric propulsion, the DSG would be able to re-position itself within cislunar space to meet the mission requirements. In a supporting role, the DSG can provide critical functionality for endeavors such as the European Space Agency's proposed Moon Village or even commercial mining operations. Because it will possess the ability to host different types of visiting vehicles, the DSG can act as a node, or transportation hub, for spacecraft traveling to and from the lunar surface. This also allows it to support the testing of necessary Mars landing technologies (those not requiring atmospheric entry), such as autonomous landing and hazard avoidance. It can also assist with the selection of ground sites for surface and science expeditions, and behave as a communications hub between the Earth and other lunar assets. Depending on its orbit the DSG can facilitate communication to assets on the lunar farside. The DSG will be an orbiting laboratory, assisting in the retrieval and curation of lunar samples for later return to Earth for analysis. This complements a Mars forward approach and can be used to test out a human-assisted Martian sample return con-ops, such as those proposed in Lockheed Martin's Mars Base Camp [1].

It was set apart from other analogue missions by its diverse and international group of students and young professionals in the space sector; its location in eastern Europe; and its independent nature, with mission control facilities provided by a local aerospace startup company and the habitat constructed by an association of private and public partners. This paper presents the preliminary results of the mission. The mission achieved its most successful results when participants, especially astronauts, felt their tasks were meaningful, and when flexibility was built into the schedule so that astronauts could leverage their human ingenuity, resourcefulness, and strong interpersonal rapport to solve problems. The skills and qualifications of the astronaut crew were also found to be crucial for mission success, as was regular communication between the habitat and Mission Support (MS) center. One of the mission's principal reasons for being is that its results can aid future analogues and, eventually, crewed Mars missions. To this end, the findings will be disseminated in future publications and conferences. In addition to revealing that these components have an outsize impact on mission success, PMAS reinforced the role that analogue missions have to play in ultimately sending a crewed mission to Mars. Some results from analogues can spawn a broad range of interpretations because of their subjective nature, particularly those results that relate to human factors such as crew attitude.

A review of past Mars mission planning efforts, however, reveals that while numerous studies have explored the challenges of transporting people to the red planet, relatively little effort has been invested in quantitatively characterizing the challenges of sustaining humans upon arrival, especially across campaigns of multiple crew landings and logistics resupply missions. In light of this trend, this paper performs an integrated architectural analysis of two long duration, multi-mission Mars campaign scenarios to evaluate the impact of various technology options on the costs of sustaining multiple crewed expeditions on the surface of Mars. Specifically, this analysis explores the effect of increasing levels of environmental control and life support (ECLS) system resource recycling and local food production on required in-situ resource utilization (ISRU) infrastructure and logistics resupply demands. This is accomplished by computing and comparing the infrastructure required to deploy and support eight representative surface system architectures, each with varying levels of life support resource recycling and food production. Through this analysis, a number of new insights on the mass-optimality of Mars surface system architectures are derived. The most significant of these is the finding that ECLS architecture mass-optimality is strongly dependent on the cost of ISRU - where open-loop ECLS architectures become mass-optimal when the cost of ISRU is low, and ECLS architectures with higher levels of resource recycling become mass-optimal when the cost of ISRU is high. For the Martian surface, the relative abundance of resources equates to a low cost of ISRU, which results in more open-loop ECLS systems supplemented with ISRU becoming an attractive, if not dominant surface system architecture, over a range of mission scenarios and ISRU performance levels.",0,2017-01-01,Conference Paper,National Aeronautics and Space Administration

On February 2017, the UAE unveiled its ambitious long-term plan “Mars Project 2117” which aims at its final stage to establish the first human settlement in Mars by 2117. In its efforts to diversify the space industry and enriching the capabilities of its engineers and scientists, the UAE Space Agency (UAESA) investigated hosting its first Deep Space Ground Station to communicate with its Mars probe, supporting future deep space missions, conducting radio astronomy science, in addition to supporting international missions and space exploration collaborations. This paper will outline the unique advantages of the geographical location of the UAE in terms of building a site similar to those of the National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) Deep Space Network (DSN), capable of a dual function: support of UAESA and international deep space missions and participation in the international Very Long Baseline Interferometry (VLBI) networks for supporting radio astronomy activities. This dual function is made possible through the UAE Ground Station’s (UAEGS) ability to communicate and support navigation of deep space missions, inter-operability with international spacecraft and ground systems using accepted standards (CCSDS for example), and frequency agility which allows for the addition of frequency bands (at least between S and Ka band) without major changes and to quickly switch between all supported frequency bands. The UAEGS geographic location complements that of other deep space sites. With respect to the NASA DSN, UAEGS can provide coverage as spacecraft transition from support by an antenna in Spain to an antenna in Australia. In addition to functioning as a single dish telescope, the UAEGS may participate in the Australian Long Baseline Array (LBA), adding north-south baselines as well as filling in gaps in the east-west baselines between Australia and South Africa.

The second type of robot builder, B-ARBie, is a brick-maker. Equipped with a static press, B-ARBie collects, filters and mixes locally sourced clay and gravel material, then vibro-presses it to produce dry bricks with interlocking profile. With moderate energy requirements, B-ARBie proceeds to build modular, vaulted structures with square or rectangular base. The third type, C-ARBie, is a stone-cutter. Equipped with a stone-cutting tool, C-ARBie has higher energy requirements relative to ARBie or B-ARBie, but can build massive vaulted structures with a variety of large, precisely shaped elements. The three robot builders share the same basic body plan: a six-legged frame with on-board PV cells and control electronics, actuated by compressed CO2 harvested from the Martian atmosphere and stored in liquid form as a rechargeable power source. As a power storage medium liquefied CO2 has energy density comparable to lead-acid batteries, but contrary to the latter can be cycled indefinitely, and is able to operate at Martian temperatures. An important advantage shared by the three robot designs is that their functionality and productivity can be easily tested and optimized on Earth. Over the course of its operational lifetime a small team of autonomous robot builders would have the potential to build a vast grid of interconnected, modular habitats out of locally sourced materials with no further need for external provisions or support.",0,2017-01-01,Conference Paper,NA

Lockheed Martin was awarded the contract for the design, development, test, and production for Orion up through Exploration Mission 2 (EM-2). Lockheed Martin is also working on defining the cislunar proving ground mission architecture, in partnership with NASA. In addition, Lockheed Martin is exploring the definition of Mars missions as the horizon goal to provide input to the plans for human exploration of the solar system. In 2016, Lockheed Martin presented a proposal for achieving crewed exploration of Martian space as early as the 2028 launch opportunity. Known as Mars Base Camp, this proposal involved establishing a crewed vehicle in Martian orbit from which astronauts could perform excursions to Deimos and Phobos, and could also perform telerobotic exploration of the Martian surface, including sample return. This concept presented a novel, practical, and affordable path to enable human exploration of the Martian system in the next decade. This paper will detail additional development for the Mars Base Camp concept, including the production of propellant from water, additional details for the cislunar proving ground missions, and a Mars lander concept. The orbiting base camp could generate oxygen and hydrogen from water via solar-powered electrolysis. Water may be provided directly from the Earth system or via in-situ resource production in the lunar, Martian, or other systems. The demonstration of Mars Base Camp capabilities at the Deep Space Gateway will be discussed, including systems, technology and scientific mission possibilities. The lander is envisioned as a fully reusable, lifting body that uses supersonic retro-propulsion to descend and land on the surface. Initial crewed missions using the lander, which would follow on later missions than the initial mission, are outlined as relatively short-duration, science-focused exploration missions. Multiple areas of the Martian surface would be explored with the objective to gather scientific data from a wide variety of sites of interest, and more fully characterize possible sites for future permanent settlements. Once a surface mission is completed, the lander returns to Mars Base Camp as a single stage to orbit launch vehicle to be refueled. With these additional developments, the Mars Base Camp concept can be seen as a core system that pivots humanity into a viable, sustainable long-term Mars exploration program.",7,2017-01-01,Conference Paper,NA

The paper reviews the design of Vanguard, a four-person inflatable habitat sized for launch on a Falcon Heavy or larger vehicle as a supplement or, ultimately, a replacement for the International Space Station in low Earth orbit. The first extension of the application domain of the habitat is as a “Deep Space Habitat” in a periodic distant orbit of the Moon, where it is no longer shielded from radiation by the Earth’s magnetic fields. The next step in terms of habitat modifications is to support human exploration of near-Earth objects or the moons of Mars, where the habitat will be located on the surface of the body and the internal systems will have to accommodate milligee-level gravitation. Extending habitat applications to the surface of the Moon or Mars changes the nature of the design from microgravity to substantial gravitational levels, with entirely separate challenges in landing the habitat on the Moon as compared to entry, descent, and landing on Mars. The final application of interest is the use of multiple Vanguard modules to create an artificial-gravity research station, using active wire tension elements to support the structures and damp out oscillations. Results of this study indicate that the investment in the development and implementation of a small modular LEO habitat will reap dividends due to its application across a broad spectrum of future exploration applications.",0,2017-01-01,Conference Paper,National Aeronautics and Space Administration

Creating a small, expandable, base on the Martian surface could be the first step towards that goal. The gradual buildup of capabilities and population over time allows for technology development and a feasible launch schedule. Once the steady-state operations are achieved, the base will support 50 people. Key exploration systems to allow for the creation of a semi-permanent base are habitation systems, environmental control and life support systems, rovers, power generation systems, and greenhouses. Multiple generations of habitats are used to provide different housing functions and environmental control and life support systems keep the crew alive. Rovers allow for the transportation of humans and cargo across the Martian surface. Power generation systems need to meet the high-power demand of the base and the greenhouses allow for food production on the surface. Advancements need to be made in both environmental control and life support systems and nuclear power generation systems to make the creation of a Martian base possible. More research needs to be done with respect to in-space plant growth because the greenhouses are a primary mass and power driver in the base.

The changes in the sizing of the crew habitat, including consumables and spares, was assessed as a function of duration, including trades of different life support strategies; this was used to assess the impact on transportation system requirements. The impact to benefit is minimal, while the impact on cost is dominated by the increases in transportation costs to achieve shorter total durations.

For the transportation to the cislunar, there three types of transfer options: 1) in-direct transfer via Powered Lunar swing-by, 2) Weak Stability Boundary Transfer in which Solar gravity perturbation is utilized, and 3) lowthrust orbit raising to Lunar orbit. The in-direct transfer requires roughly 500 m/s order of delta-V however the Time-of-Flight, TOF from Earth to Cislunar is practically short i.e., roughly 5~7 days. This type of transfer is assumed for human transportations. The WSB transfer will significantly decrease the required delta-V, however the TOF will be 2~6 months and it will largely change depending on the launch epoch. The low-thrust orbit raising will increase the payload mass, however it will take 6~12 months to get to the destination. Considering such situation, this paper focuses on a new type of low-thrust transfer option which fulfils the significant gap between the two transfer methods. The proposed method is called Electric Delta-V Lunar Gravity Assist, EDV-LGA. The use of electric propulsion will reduce the fuel mass for the transfer, besides the TOF of EDV-LGA is roughly 1 month which is almost equivalent to the lifesupport capability of Orion. As another merit of the low-thrust transfer, the author thinks it may also increase the safety of human transportation to the habitat. If some trouble occurs at the impulsive delta-V in the in-direct transfer, the manned space ship may not be able to come back to the Earth within the duration of a life support system. However, the low-thrust transfer is relatively easily restored from such kinds of troubles. These characteristics of the proposed transfer method will provide a new transfer option for future deep-space habitat.∗.",0,2017-01-01,Conference Paper,NA

Two important choices make this architecture affordable and appropriate for the first mission. The first is splitting the Earth return vehicle into two parts that are launched separately and dock in Mars orbit. This is necessary to make aerocapture feasible and efficient, which considerably reduces mass. The second is reducing the crew to 3 astronauts. This simplifies the mission and reduces the SLS payload mass under the 45-metric ton limit for a direct TMI (trans-Mars injection) burn without LEO assembly. Only 4 SLS launches are required. The first takes the Mars ascent vehicle and in situ resource utilization systems to the planet's surface. The second takes the first part of the Earth return vehicle, the habitat, into Mars orbit. Two years later, two further SLS launches take a dual-use habitat (outbound trip and surface), Orion, and an enhanced service module to LEO, and then into Mars orbit, followed by the landing of the habitat on the surface.

Instead of transporting all the construction materials from Earth to the red planet with incredibly high cost, using Martian soil to construct a site on Mars is a superior choice. Knowing that Mars has long been considered a “sulfur-rich planet” a new construction material composed of simulated Martian soil and molten sulfur is developed. In addition to the raw material availability for producing sulfur concrete and a strength reaching similar or higher levels of conventional cementitious concrete, fast curing, low temperature sustainability, acid and salt environment resistance, 100% recyclability are appealing superior characteristics of the developed Martian Concrete. In this study, different percentages of sulfur are investigated to obtain the optimal mixing proportions. Three point bending, unconfined compression and splitting tests were conducted to determine strength development, strength variability, and failure mechanisms. The test results show that the strength of Martian Concrete doubles that of sulfur concrete utilizing regular sand. It is also shown that the particle size distribution plays an important role in the mixture's final strength. Furthermore, since Martian soil is metal rich, sulfates and, potentially, polysulfates are also formed during high temperature mixing, which might contribute to the high strength. The optimal mix developed as Martian Concrete has an unconfined compressive strength of above 50 MPa.

84978488549,Human exploration missions to phobos prior to crewed mars surface missions,Gernhardt M.L.,NA,IEEE Aerospace Conference Proceedings,2016-June,NA,NA,10.1109/AERO.2016.7500718,"Phobos is a scientifically interesting destination which offers engineering, operational and public outreach activities that could enhance subsequent Mars surface missions. A Phobos mission would serve to facilitate the development of the human-based Mars transportation infrastructure, unmanned cargo delivery systems, as well as habitation and exploration assets that would be directly relevant to subsequent Mars surface missions. It would also potentially provide for low latency teleoperations (LLT) of Mars surface robots performing a range of tasks from landing site validation to infrastructure development to support future crewed Mars surface Missions. A human mission to Phobos would be preceded by a cargo predeploy of a Phobos surface habitat and a pressurized excursion vehicle (PEV) to Mars orbit. Once in Mars orbit, the habitat and PEV would spiral to Phobos using solar electric propulsion (SEP)-based systems. When a crewed mission is launched to Phobos, it would include the remaining systems to support the crew during the Earth-to-Mars orbit transit and to reach Phobos after insertion into a high Mars orbit (HMO). The crew would taxi from HMO to Phobos in a spacecraft that is based on a MAV to rendezvous with the predeployed systems. A predominantly static Phobos surface habitat was chosen as a baseline architecture. The habitat would have limited capability to relocate on the surface to shorten excursion distances required by the PEV during exploration and to provide rescue capability should the PEV become disabled. PEVs would contain closed-loop guidance and provide life support and consumables for two crewmembers for two weeks plus reserves. The PEV has a cabin that uses the exploration atmosphere of 8.2psi with 34% oxygen. This atmosphere enables EVA to occur with minimal oxygen prebreathe before crewmembers enter their EVA suits through suit ports, and provides dust control to occur by keeping the suits outside the pressurized volume. When equipped with outriggers, the PEV enables EVA tasks without the need to anchor. Tasks with higher force requirements can be performed with PEV propulsion providing the necessary thrust to counteract forces. This paper overviews the mission operational concepts, and timelines, along with analysis of the power, lighting, habitat stability, and EVA forces. Exploration of Phobos builds heavily on the development of the cis-lunar proving ground and significantly reduces Mars surface risk by facilitating the design, development and testing of habitats, MAVs, and pressurized rover cabins that are all investments in Mars surface assets.",6,2016-06-27,Conference Paper,NA
85088058492,Why deep space habitats should be different from the international space station,Griffin B.N.,NA,"AIAA Space and Astronautics Forum and Exposition, SPACE 2016",NA,NA,NA,10.2514/6.2016-5278,"It is tempting to assume the International Space Station (ISS) as the model for deep space habitats. This is not a good idea for several reasons. One is that the ISS does not have a habitation module; instead habitation features such as private crew quarters are dispersed across several modules, the galley is in the US Laboratory and the waste hygiene compartment is in a Node. This distributed arrangement was not the original plan but the result of making the best of the difficult ISS development process. None the less, important differences distinguish a deep space habitat from the ISS. First, the launch vehicle is no longer available. The Space Shuttle that shaped, sized, and delivered most ISS elements was designed for low-earth orbit and is now retired. Its replacement, the Space Launch System (SLS), is specifically designed for human exploration beyond low-earth orbit and is capable of transporting more efficient, large diameter, heavy-lift payloads. Next, unlike ISS crews that are shielded from lethal radiation by the earth’s magnetic field, astronauts in deep space require either a storm shelter or use strategically positioned equipment for protection. The SLS large diameter envelope allows layouts with surrounding equipment to protect centrally located crew quarters; a feature not possible with ISS diameter concepts. Another important difference is that exploration destinations preclude an ISS-type emergency return. For example, it takes 7 to 10 days to go between Earth and cis-lunar exploration locations and approximately 1000 days for the Mars habitat transit. These distant destinations will have infrequent or no resupply thus emphasizing habitat autonomy with provisions for in-situ maintenance. In contrast, the ISS rack-packaged subsystems are not maintenance-friendly relying on close proximity to earth for frequent delivery and return. In addition, the ISS interchangeable rack architecture is a heavy solution. It requires additional structure to support internal components and has complex, repetitive utility routing both within the rack and throughout the modules. Habitats without racks will be lighter and with a single launch habitat there is little reason for rack-level modularity. Instead, a better solution provides direct access to single-layer packaging allowing astronauts to reach components without first having to remove another. Hatch size is likely to be another difference. ISS modules and supporting logistics vehicles must have large aisle ways and 50 x 50 inch (1.27 m x 1.27 m) hatches to accommodate rack translation. On the other hand, the Orion crew capsule that docks to the deep space habitat uses the NASA Docking System (NDS) 32 inch (0.81 m) diameter hatch. Fully integrated habitats will not depend on ISS rack-level, on-orbit outfitting therefore eliminating larger hatches and translation paths. Using only the NDS hatch is cost saving solution providing commonality benefits across the exploration architecture. Operational readiness is another important discriminator. The ISS required over 100 flights to build, resupply, and transport the crew, whereas a SLS solution is operational after the first launch at reduced cost, mass, and complexity.",0,2016-01-01,Conference Paper,NA
85086948482,Sizing a common habitat for multiple environments and mission durations,Scott Howe A.,NA,"AIAA Space and Astronautics Forum and Exposition, SPACE 2016",NA,NA,NA,10.2514/6.2016-5455,"A human mission to Mars and other deep space destinations will require a consistent habitation strategy that applies to disparate environments preferably using multiples of identical hardware. The crew will endure high-g forces during launch, microgravity during transit, and various partial gravities on the destination planet, moon, or asteroid. Habitable volume will likely need to be broken up into smaller modules that do not exceed the capacity of launch vehicles and entry-descent-landing technologies. Though it may be possible to design a different unique, optimized habitat for each environment that the crew may encounter, it is more likely that space agencies and other mission sponsors will only have the resources to develop and produce single multi-use hardware that can be used equally well in all environments, with minimal adaptation by the crew. When sizing habitable volume, mission duration and number of crew become important factors to consider. For example, a pressurized rover cabin may only need to support two crew members for a few days at a time, requiring less volume than a habitat that must support the same number of persons for an entire year. In this study the authors consider constraining factors such as launch vehicle capacity, mission duration, crew size, and Mars lander capacity and study how to divide total pressurized volume, subsystems, equipment, consumables, and supplies into multiple manifests. Preference has been given to solutions that use multiples of identical modules over unique optimized volumes. For example at one extreme, can all the habitat pressure vessels, logistic modules, Mars ascent stage cabins, rover cabins, and airlocks be constructed from multiples of the same small-diameter cylindrical modules? On the other extreme, can logistics, habitation volume, mobility, all be enclosed in a single monolithic volume habitat design? Though there may be advantages and disadvantages to either extreme, the conclusion of this study is that most functions can be distilled into two sizes for hardware: multiples of large diameter modules that generally stay in one place, and multiples of smaller volume cabins that can be moved around or function as cockpits for ascent stages, support vehicles, rovers, airlocks, and logistics delivery.",0,2016-01-01,Conference Paper,NA
85086056903,Beyond “man in a can”: Designing small in-space human vehicles for mission and program requirements,Akin D.L.,NA,"AIAA Space and Astronautics Forum and Exposition, SPACE 2016",NA,NA,NA,10.2514/6.2016-5235,"The concept of a small, maneuverable spacecraft for one or two people has been proposed for a number of missions and applications, dating back to Wernher von Braun in the 1950’s. Prior studies of the published literature was unable to find a single instance where the concept was ever taken beyond “viewgraph”-level visuals. In general, this category of small 1-2 person spacecraft has gotten short shrift in mission architectures; whether it is due to lack of applicable prior flight experience or the dismissive nature of the “man in a can” label is impossible to say. This paper looks at the generic category of small human spacecraft for microgravity operations, in the context of both maintenance and servicing of space systems and of microgravity explorations of solar system minor bodies such as asteroids, comets, or the moons of Mars. Critical mission performance parameters are identified, such as distance from base (in terms of both transit time and Δv), duration of sortie, and required operations (in terms of required reach and dexterity). In parallel, fundamental design choices are identified, such as number of crew, use of multiple vehicles for safety, and provision of robotic and/or EVA capabilities. Comparative details for the canonical reference designs include size of crew (1-3), sortie duration (hours-days), dexterity (robotic, external manual manipulation, full EVA support), and maneuvering performance (Δv). The goal of this analysis is to determine the effect of mission specifications on the preferred choices in vehicle configuration. For example, probabilistic risk analysis shows that vehicle failures can occur which variously threaten crew survival immediately (e.g., life support system failure) or longer-term (e.g., propulsion system failure). Response to these contingencies may include deployment of a second small spacecraft as a rescue vehicle, or designing sorties to always have two vehicles capable of mutual support and crew rescue at need. Other options considered include the provision of operational or contingency (“bail-out”) space suits, with or without independent translation flight systems embedded. Results indicate that concatenations of multiple vehicles and safety systems can drive the loss of crew probability to arbitrarily low values, but at the price of increased mission mass and the cost for developing and deploying additional systems. Results to date indicate that this category of small “space utility vehicles” (SUVs) offer real advantages in terms of the range and complexity of mission objectives, while minimizing the chance of loss of crew as compared to conventional EVA sorties. There are also advantages in terms of required denitrogenation times and overall mission performance in both spacecraft servicing and minor body exploration activities. The appropriate next step will be to develop and test a complete SUV concept in functional neutral buoyancy operations.",0,2016-01-01,Conference Paper,NA

For missions to Mars (such as NASA's Evolvable Mars Campaign (EMC)), where timely resupply or abort in the event of emergency will not be possible, maintenance logistics mass is directly linked to the Probability of Loss of Crew (P(LoC)), and the cost of driving down risk is an exponential in-crease in mass requirements. The logistics support strategies that have maintained human operations in LEO will not be effective for these deep space missions. In-Space Manufacturing (ISM) is a promising technological solution that could reduce logistics requirements, mitigate risks, and augment operational capabilities, enabling Earth-independent human spaceight. This paper reviews maintenance logistics challenges for spaceight operations in LEO and beyond, and presents a summary of selected results from a systems analysis of potential ISM applications for the ISS and EMC. A quantitative modeling framework and sample assessment of maintenance logistics and risk reduction potential of this new technology is also presented. In the Mars transit habitat case study examined here, ISM enabled a 28% reduction in maintenance logistics mass when applied to approximately one third of the components within the system, and the addition of materials recycling capability increased this to 34%. Looking specifically at the components that were assumed to be within the capability of the ISM system to produce, ISM reduced maintenance logistics mass by 78.3% from the amount required for those parts when traditional spare parts are used. ISM with materials recycling capability enabled a reduction of 97.7%. These results are discussed in the context of ongoing and future human spaceight efforts, and conclusions are presented.",21,2016-01-01,Conference Paper,NA

85016513515,Design considerations for spacecraft operations during uncrewed dormant phases of human exploration missions,Williams-Byrd J.,NA,"Proceedings of the International Astronautical Congress, IAC",NA,NA,NA,NA,"NASA is transforming human spaceflight. The Agency is shifting from an exploration-based program with human activities in low Earth orbit (LEO) and targeted robotic missions in deep space to a more sustainable and integrated pioneering approach. Through pioneering, NASA seeks to address national goals to develop the capacity for people to work, learn, operate, live, and thrive safely beyond the Earth for extended periods of time. However, pioneering space involves daunting technical challenges of transportation, maintaining health, and enabling crew productivity for long durations in remote, hostile, and alien environments. Subject matter experts from NASA's Human Exploration and Operations Mission Directorate (HEOMD) are currently studying a human exploration campaign that involves pre-deployment of assets for planetary exploration. This study, called the Evolvable Mars Campaign (EMC) study, has identified solar electric propulsion as the in-space transportation architecture which involves long duration periods of transit to destinations. The EMC study is also investigating pre-deployment of human rated systems like landers and habitats to the surface of Mars, which also will involve long periods of time when these systems are either in transit or staged on the surface. In order to enable the EMC architecture, autonomous vehicle operations must be utilized during these long periods of dormant operations to ensure the systems are ready for use when the astronauts arrive on the planet. Subject matter experts from HEOMD's System Maturation Team have identified additional critical capabilities, systems and operations that are needed to enable EMC missions especially during these dormant phases of the mission. Dormancy is defined by the absence of crew and relative inactivity of the systems. For EMC missions, dormant periods could range from several months to several years. Two aspects of uncrewed dormant operations are considered herein: (1) the vehicle systems that are placed in a dormant state and (2) the autonomous vehicle systems and robotic capabilities that monitor, maintain, and repair the vehicle and systems. This paper will describe the mission stage of dormancy operations, phases of dormant operations, and critical system capabilities that are needed for dormant operations. This paper will compare dormancy operations of past robotic missions to identify lessons that can be applied to planned human exploration missions. The paper will also provide analysis regarding the complexity of systems needed for this unique type of operation. Finally, this paper will also identify future work and analysis planned to assess system performance metrics and integrated system operations.",5,2016-01-01,Conference Paper,NA

This vehicle could be used to provide crew habitat for the exploration of cislunar space, near earth asteroids and Mars. The goal is to allow an entity, such as NASA, to leverage assets such as commercial and international partners by using near term or pre-existing hardware in a modular fashion. There exist today countless different pieces of space hardware, modules and vehicles that differ in their development level from preliminary designs to flight tested hardware. The ability to add or subtract modules at different points in a timeline could fall in line with the stepping stones approach NASA wishes to take. A portfolio optimization technique is used to explore combinations of pre-existing or near term hardware that work cohesively to meet overarching capability objectives. This approach also allows for the performance uncertainty of development stage hardware. Connectivity constraints of hardware are addressed through the use of network theory. This approach offers benefits such as robust design and the ability to spread a space budget across multiple sources of funding. The evolutionary capability of such an approach allows for early vehicle and hardware testing similar to the progression of the International Space Station. Disadvantages include the lack of complete control over portions of the every system and the added complexity in combining hardware. The aim of this study is to provide a useful metric when comparing to a single source monolithic space vehicle. Example scenarios explored at the end of this paper include the application of this method to exploration class missions including near Earth architectures, Mars architectures and an Earth-Mars cycler.",0,2016-01-01,Conference Paper,NA

Data on anthropometrical and interaction movements need to be collected in order to address the design of the habitat. In the past, physiological data have been collected without addressing the need for application in the field of architectural design. This research will investigate a methodology that focuses on the collection of basic anthropometrical and postural data needed to develop interfaces for Moon and Mars gravity environments. The methodology proposed here consists of the utilization of the swimming pool of the Neutral Buoyancy Facility at the European Astronaut Centre. By using a combination of distributed mechanical loads on different parts of a subject's body (and, possibly, floaters to optimize the application point of the resultant force), a realistic reduced gravity effect can be obtained. Optionally, the subject could interact with a Moon or Mars habitat or terrain created within the Neutral Buoyancy Facility. The data will be collected via underwater video recording. The data will be compared with a control study performed using the same structure but outside the water. As a result, the walking patterns will be visualized schematically and with images.

We model SpaceX's Mars Colonial Transporter (MCT) plans as closely as possible, based on publicly available information, including their announced goal of building and maintaining a one million-person settlement on Mars. We develop credible estimates of a reusable, multi-stage spacecraft for moving humans and cargo between Earth and Mars each 26-month synodic period, as well as additional spacecraft for moving CH4/O2 propellant from either Earth's surface or the Moon to a LEO depot. Additional propellant is produced on Mars for spacecraft returning to Earth. Consumables, passenger cargo and crew are included, but other infrastructure requirements (including the more significant and technologically challenging Mars surface infrastructure needs) are not examined. We assume 10 cargo trips per passenger trip, resulting in 16 t/passenger of cargo to provide physical infrastructure for the Mars settlement. We develop a scenario starting in 2042 to achieve a Mars settlement population of one million after 90 years, taking into account finite ship lifetimes, transport capacity growth, population growth and attrition from those returning to Earth. Cumulative fleet mass is estimated at 21 million tonnes (Mt), while cumulative propellant mass is 270 times as large (5,600 Mt). Cumulative shipped cargo is 22 Mt. We find that very significant mass and energy savings are available in shifting propellant production for the LEO refuelling depot from Earth to the Moon, resulting in 77 percent less cumulative propellant or 1,260 Mt. However, a source of lunar carbon is required, which may need to be supplied from the Earth or asteroids, and raises concerns about depletion of limited lunar water resources. We also considered shifting from CH4/O2 to H2/O2 propellant, but it results in approximately the same lunar water demand. Therefore, entirely asteroid-derived propellant may be necessary in the long term. SpaceX's proposed plan provides 5 m3/person habitable volume, which is very cramped compared with the International Space Station (65 m3/person); we estimate that increasing this habitable volume to a more reasonable 20 m3/person would increase mass and energy requirements by 2.4 times, however. We consider reductions in shipped cargo mass, human hibernation to reduce spacecraft and consumables mass, and space elevators as possible long-term strategies to reduce cumulative mass and energy requirements.",0,2016-01-01,Conference Paper,NA
85016460868,An approach to study additive manufacturing of regolith simulant under vacuum and reduced gravity environment,Ghosh A.,NA,"Proceedings of the International Astronautical Congress, IAC",NA,NA,NA,NA,"There has been a visionary approach since a decade to establish a base on Earth's little dusty neighbor, the Moon. We need to explore the Moon since it is the perfect outpost to accumulate resources outside the Earth's gravitational field. An operational lunar village would be economical, resourceful and efficient to transport materials for settlement on Mars and conduct further missions into deep space. Future robotic and manned missions to the Moon must be reliable and safe for operating all the necessary equipment in order to utilize the Moon's IN-SITU resources (ISRU). Our aim is to study regolith behavior under combined effect of vacuum and reduced gravity environment. During past Apollo missions, lunar regolith grains created unfavorable scenarios, indexing dust issues related to human safety and robotic activities as for rovers. Our approach will reevaluate the scenarios and continue research to invent a beneficial and effective technology to pave the lunar surface for preventing astronauts and all service equipment from dust effects. This paper portrays examinations of different techniques for stabilizing the lunar regolith for dust moderation. We performed experiments through our several attempts of solar sintering on regolith simulant with a breadboard system attached to a Fresnel lens which has created a sufficient amount of temperature nearly 1200°C and melted regolith within a short time. Corresponding to solar sintering, we have observed the effects of laser sintering on regolith simulant(JSC-1) for 3D printing. Throughout many iterations, both techniques were able to produce fused metallic glass with an adequate amount of strength to create additive layer bonds for printing structures. Our innovation is adequately exceptional for 3D printing of structures with regolith under vacuum environment. At this initial stage of building an experiment, our primary objective is to get a glimpse of the laser beam impact and reaction on regolith simulant, positioned inside vacuum environment. The process of dust behavior analysis will take place inside a chamber connected to a turbomolecular pump which will create vacuum inside the chamber. The mitigation techniques to stabilize dust would characterize the effects quantitatively. The final phase of this experiment is to develop a methodology with an economic aspect and technical support in order to build and test a Regolith-3D-printer in a parabolic flight campaign. Our approach aims to accelerate this experimental research by enhancing the technology and find a substitute for the conventional method of additive manufacturing process for future Lunar constructions.",0,2016-01-01,Conference Paper,NA

These structures feature flexible composites folded at high packing efficiency, which can drastically reduce launch costs. However, they can also be damaged due to the harsh extraterrestrial operating conditions, which can propagate to cause catastrophic mission failure and endanger crew safety. Therefore, it is imperative to integrate a robust structural health monitoring (SHM) system, so that damage and faults can be detected for ensuring their safe and reliable operations. While a variety of SHM technologies have been developed for monitoring conventional, rigid, structural systems, they are faced with challenges when used for these unconventional flexible and inflatable systems. Therefore, a flexible carbon nanotube-fabric nanocomposite sensor is proposed in this study for monitoring the integrity of inflatable space structures. In particular, CNT-based thin films were fabricated by spraying and then integrated with flexible fabric to form the lightweight sensor. By coupling fabric sensors with an electrical impedance tomography (EIT) algorithm, the fabric's distribution of spatial resistivity can be mapped using only electrical measurements obtained along the material's boundaries. The severity and location of localized pressure and impact damage can be captured by observing changes in the EIT-calculated resistivity maps. They can be embedded in inflatable habitat structures to detect and locate abnormally high pressure regions and impact damage.",2,2016-01-01,Conference Paper,National Science Foundation

84995544549,Design and testing of an inflatable airlock concept,Akin D.,NA,"AIAA Space and Astronautics Forum and Exposition, SPACE 2016",NA,NA,NA,NA,"Under support from the NASA X-Hab university program administered through the National Space Grant Foundation, the University of Maryland Space Systems Laboratory has been developing and testing an inflatable airlock appropriate for use on commercial crew vehicles such as Dragon or Starliner, or as a precursor for inflatable habitats for deep space or Mars moon exploration missions. The project team began with the development of a baseline design for a two-person inflatable airlock, with a NASA International Docking System on one end and the egress hatch on the other. A series of human factors evaluations in the University of Maryland Neutral Buoyancy Research Facility were performed to examine the required size for the inflatable airlock. The system was sized for two pressure-suited crew, and an overall configuration of 1.5 m in diameter and 2 m long was selected. The design activity looked at both planetary surface and microgravity airlock applications. While an axial airlock configuration (hatches in the ends of the cylindrical configuration) were preferred for both microgravity applications and overall ease of fabrication, radial egress (rectangular hatches 1x1.5 m in the cylindrical walls) was preferred for operations in higher gravities. Underwater testing with appropriately ballasted test subjects demonstrated that the gravitational levels of Phobos and Deimos were insufficient to require the radial hatch configuration, which was found to markedly reduce the potential packing factor of the airlock (ratio between inflated and stowed volumes). Model testing at 1/10 scale was used to validate the overall system design and deployment. Scale models were also used to evaluate competing designs for the internal airlock structure, used to maintain the open volume of the envelope while depressurized. Options investigated included inflatable structures around the cylindrical wall and crew-installed “battens” to maintain envelope shape without internal pressure. This effort led to the development of a 1/5 scale inflatable airlock test fixture, with a double-layer separately inflatable pressure bladder to maintain airlock rigidity after internal depressurization. One of the major design efforts in the early stage was to develop innovative hatch designs which are held sealed by internal pressure, but once unlatched can be opened outwards rather than requiring internal airlock volume in the open position. A number of concepts were developed and evaluated in CAD models, and the two best were prototyped at 1/10 scale for evaluations including integration with the scale airlock envelope and tests of their ability to support internal pressure at 4.3 psi. The major focus of the second half of the research was to develop technologies to enable a full-scale inflatable airlock prototype. A complete design was established for a flight airlock, including meeting a design internal pressure of 14.7 psi with a NASA-required factor of safety of 4. This led to the use of a woven network of high-strength straps to restrain the axial and hoop loads. It also required the design of a particularly massive aluminum plate structure for the airlock hatch and mating bulkhead. Since this project involved minimal funding ($15K), the flight design was modified for testing in the university environment. The endcaps and hatch structure were fabricated in marine-grade plywood impregnated with epoxy for testing in the underwater environment. A full-sized mockup of the airlock structure was created using PVC pipe and fittings as a rigid simulation of the inflatable airlock envelope, and the hatch attached for neutral buoyancy human factors testing. EVA standard handrails and other interfaces were added in response to test subject inputs to allow simple use of the hatch articulation, which involved pulling the D-shaped hatch inward several inches, followed by rotating it 90o on a pivot about an axis normal to the hatch surface. This allowed the crew to rotate the hatch back through the smaller D-shaped seal to come to rest outside of the airlock prior to egress. This approach minimized internal volume required for hatch opening or closing, but provided a seal compressed (and locked) by internal pressure. Due to the extremely limited resources, it was decided to prototype the overall pressure envelope in 1/2 scale. Two such prototypes were developed, with the second meeting all requirements for system inflation and rigidization following venting of the internal volume to ambient. The final prototype was also equipped with a woven web restraint layer, which while not required for this specific test article, was used for studying packing approaches for the multilayer pressure envelope. This brief and limited development program demonstrated the ability of a university laboratory, working through both freshman-and senior-level classes, to perform complex design, development, and test operations for a major aerospace habitat component. More than fifty undergraduates were involved at some level in the airlock design, fabrication, and testing.",0,2016-01-01,Conference Paper,NA

The NASA Evolvable Mars Campaign (EMC) has proposed a misson to the moons of Mars as a transitional step for eventual Mars surface exploration. While a Mars transit habitat would be parked in High-Mars Orbit (HMO), crew members would visit the surface of Phobos multiple times for up to 14 days duration (up to 50 days at a time with logistics support). This paper describes a small body surface mobility concept that is capable of transporting a small, two-person Pressurized Exploration Vehicle (PEV) cabin to various sites of interest in the low-gravity environment. Using stored kinetic energy between bounces, a propellant-saving hopper mobility system can release the energy to vector the vehicle away from the surface in a specified direction. Alternatively, the stored energy can be retained for later use while the vehicle is stationary in respect to the surface. The hopper actuation was modeled using a variety of launch velocities, and the hopper mobility was evaluated using NASA Exploration Systems Simulations (NExSyS) for transit between surface sites of interest.

Flyby and return trajectories can be combined into minimum energy paths with low to zero post-Earth departure maneuvers. By emplacing the large crew vehicles required for human transit on these paths, the total fuel cost can be reduced. The traditional full-up repeating Earth-Mars-Earth cycler concept requires significant infrastructure, but a Mars only flyby approach minimizes mission mass and maximizes opportunities to build-up missions in a stepwise manner. In this paper multiple strategies for sending a crew of 4 to Mars orbit and back are examined. With pre-emplaced assets in Mars orbit, a transit habitat and a minimally functional Mars taxi, a complete Mars mission can be accomplished in 3 SLS launches and 2 Mars Flybys, including Orion. While some years are better than others, ample opportunities exist within a given 15-year Earth-Mars alignment cycle.

The FY’15 EMC effort focused upon analysis of integrated mission architectures to identify technically appealing transportation strategies, logistics build-up strategies, and vehicle designs for reaching and exploring Mars moons and Mars surface. As part of the development of this campaign, long duration habitats are required which are capable of supporting crew with limited resupply and crew abort during the Mars transit, Mars moons, and Mars surface segments of EMC missions. In particular, the EMC design team sought to design a single, affordable habitation system whose manufactured units could be outfitted uniquely for each of these missions and reused for multiple crewed missions. This habitat system must provide all of the functionality to safely support 4 crew for long durations while meeting mass and volume constraints for each of the mission segments set by the chosen transportation architecture and propulsion technologies. This paper describes several proposed long-duration habitation strategies to enable the Evolvable Mars Campaign through improvements in mass, cost, and reusability, and presents results of analysis to compare the options and identify promising solutions. The concepts investigated include several monolithic concepts: monolithic clean sheet designs, and concepts which leverage the co-manifested payload capability of NASA’s Space Launch System (SLS) to deliver habitable elements within the Universal Payload Adaptor between the SLS upper stage and the Orion/Service module on the top of the vehicle. Multiple modular habitat options for Mars surface and in-space missions are also considered with various functionality and volume splits between modules to find the best balance of reducing the single largest mass which must be delivered to a destination and reducing the number of separate elements which must be launched. Analysis results presented for each of these concepts in this paper include mass/volume/power sizing using parametric sizing tools, identification of unique operational constraints, and limited comments on the additional impacts of reusability/dormancy on system design. Finally, recommendations will be made for promising solutions which will be carried forward for consideration in the Evolvable Mars Campaign work.",16,2015-01-01,Conference Paper,NA

In order to establish a manned base on Mars, one of the first steps is to better understand the Martian environment, and develop technology that allows humans to travel and survive there. In order to achieve these goals a feasibility study of a mission to the proximity of Mars has been performed. This was done over six months by twelve international students as part of the SpacE Exploration and Development Systems (SEEDS) Masters Course. Orpheus is a 602 day return mission to the vicinity of Mars, comprised of two manned Phobos landings and three robotic Mars surface probes. It proposes the use of two spacecraft: a manned Crew Interplanetary Vehicle (CIV); and a cargo vehicle, the Mars Automated Transfer Vehicle (MATV). Scientific advancements, technological progress, increased public interest in space and international cooperation are the main objectives of this mission. An innovative configuration of the CIV was designed to sustain a crew of six for the mission duration. The CIV is considered to depart from LEO in 2036 using cryogenic propulsion for Trans-Mars injection (TMI). Once in Mars proximity, the primary manoeuvres are performed using nuclear thermal propulsion and a bi-propellant chemical system for the minor manoeuvres. The CIV has a calculated IMLEO of 3981 tonnes, comparable to that of the ISS construction mass, considering the 37 shuttle launches. In order to perform some preliminary science analysis and landing sites investigation the MATV would arrive two years before the CIV. It would use a low thrust trajectory, transporting the Phobos Lander, an Orbital Laboratory-for initial sample analysis-and three planetary rovers providing a distributed Mars surface analysis network. The MATV will stay in Martian orbit after the CIV departs, providing a communications relay for the surface probes. Significant challenges to the design, such as the integrated radiation dose received by astronauts and the propellant boil-off problem were investigated: proposals for mitigating them are provided in the paper. In addition a detailed trajectory analysis was performed, and innovative propulsion systems and inflatable habitable modules were considered.

84991574522,Next steps in the evolvable path to mars,Joseph Cassady R.,NA,"Proceedings of the International Astronautical Congress, IAC",12,NA,9177-9186,NA,"NASA is currently underway developing the Space Launch System (SLS) to carry crew and cargo beyond low Earth orbit (LEO). The heavy lift capabilities of the SLS will enable spacecraft and mission architecture flexibility not achievable with current or proposed alternative, medium and heavy lift launch vehicles. The SLS is being designed in an evolutionary approach to provide increased performance as NASA's Exploration program advances. This approach will see the SLS grow from an initial configuration (Block 1) capable of lifting more than 70mT to LEO to an intermediate configuration (Block IB) capable of 105mT to LEO, and ultimately evolving to a configuration (Block 2B) capable of 130mT to LEO. The next steps of human exploration in space will depend on the development of deep space exploration capabilities needed to support extensive missions in hostile environments in preparation for a human mission to Mars. Recent work in Europe and the US has established the need for more data on the combined effects of microgravity and radiation on crew members. Also, architecture studies have established the need for improved in-space transportation of non-time critical cargo. In fact, it may be possible to reduce the costs of a human campaign of Mars expeditions by as much as 60% over the previously estimated cost targets. This will provide an affordable and sustainable approach that will allow the US and its international partners to begin preparing now by developing the required elements. As we move forward into missions that prepare the way for Mars, a Deep Space Habitat and a Solar Electric Propulsion (SEP)-based transfer stage may represent the next logical capabilities that should be developed according to an incremental build-up logic. Together with SLS and Orion, these new capabilities would allow a number of exciting interim missions to be executed in the cis-lunar environment and demonstrate critical capabilities that will be employed for eventual human Mars missions in the 203 O's. This paper will describe one such concept that can utilize heritage from the ISS as the basis for the habitat and leverage the efficient transportation capabilities of a SEP transfer stage to position it in a lunar orbit.",1,2015-01-01,Conference Paper,NA

84991491901,Automated risk and supportability model generation for repairable systems,Owens A.,NA,"Proceedings of the International Astronautical Congress, IAC",11,NA,8356-8364,NA,"As human space exploration missions expand beyond Low Earth Orbit (LEO) to destinations such as Cislunar space, Near-Earth Asteroids, and Mars, the logistics associated with repair and maintenance will become significantly more challenging. The logistics paradigm of the International Space Station (ISS) may not be feasible for future missions; longer mission durations increase the chance of component failures, and greater distances from Earth increase both the cost and time required for resupply. In some cases, particularly for Mars exploration missions, a contingency abort back to Earth may not be feasible in a reasonable amount of time. As a result, reliability and supportability will become more dominant design drivers. Decisions made early in the system architecting and design process can have a significant impact on the overall risk taken on during a mission, which can result in costly operational or logistics support requirements in order to ensure safe operation with a high probability of achieving mission goals. A full and timely understanding of the risk and supportability implications that architecture and design decisions will have during future mission operations-obtained at the time that those decisions are made-can help engineers develop systems that can achieve demanding exploration mission goals in a safe, reliable, and cost-effective manner. This paper presents a framework to incorporate automated risk and supportability analysis support into Model-Based Systems Engineering (MBSE) efforts in order to support risk-informed system development, focusing on repairable systems. A notional Mars surface habitat is presented as a case study. System and mission design data such as individual component reliabilities and resupply frequency are used to automatically generate a semi-Markov supportability model, which is then used to derive the relationship between spares mass and risk as well as the distribution of the amount of contingency supplies required over the course of the mission. We discuss the implications of these results with regard to the applicability of this framework to different points in the development process, as well as the potential benefits of this approach and planned future extensions. The goal of this framework is to support rapid examination of different architecture and design options and perform quantitative system trade studies while taking risk and operational/logistical requirements into account.",1,2015-01-01,Conference Paper,NA

The authors propose the use of an Immersive Virtual Reality (IVR) system a5 a tool for astronaut training, space system design, and space life sciences research. While many applications are foreseen for IVR in human spaceflight, this paper discusses only terrain reconnaissance and mission planning, surface EVA training, neurovestibular adaptation, robotic operations, and spacecraft and habitat design. The IVR solution augments the Oculus Rift head mounted display with motion and gesture tracking, enabled by the Kinect sensor and a purpose-built omnidirectional treadmill. Fidelity of simulation for ambulation on extra-Terrestrial planetary surfaces is further increased through the use of custom-built reduced gravity simulator, which replicates an astronaut's centre of gravity dynamics on the surface of a selected planetary body. The IVR system has been deployed and tested at four analogue Mars missions in Austria and Italy, using 3D terrains generated from satellite and digital elevation model imagery, stereoimage pairs, and arrays of photographs for 3D photogrammetry. It has demonstrated value in numerous applications, and its evaluation for others is ongoing. Mission and flight planners have identified it as an invaluable tool in mission design, site selection, traverse planning, and protocol development. It has successfully addressed many of the challenges encountered by Apollo moonwalking astronauts by enabling crews to familiarize themselves with the terrain to be explored a priori, substantially reducing uncertainty in traverse paths and distances, scientific site selection, and hazard identification. The IVR system is being used in ongoing neurovestibular adaptation research. Decoupling of the vestibulospinal reflex, as seen in astronauts upon returning from long-duration spaceflight, has been reproduced using IVR. These areas of research are ongoing, and the system is foreseen as an integral planning and preparation and astronaut tool for future exploration of extra-Terrestrial planetary bodies, particularly unique for its low operating costs and unprecedented fidelity for planetary surfaces. It is expected to substantially aid in risk mitigation in the next era of human space exploration to previously unexplored bodies.",3,2015-01-01,Conference Paper,NA
84960445631,Small habitat commonality reduces cost for human mars missions,Griffin B.,NA,AIAA SPACE 2015 Conference and Exposition,NA,NA,NA,NA,"Most view the Apollo Program as expensive. It was. But, a human mission to Mars will be orders of magnitude more difficult and costly. Recently, NASA’s Evolvable Mars Campaign (EMC) mapped out a step-wise approach for exploring Mars and the Mars-moon system. It is early in the planning process but because approximately 80% of the total life cycle cost is committed during preliminary design, there is an effort to emphasize cost reduction methods up front. Amongst the options, commonality across small habitat elements shows promise for consolidating the high bow-wave costs of Design, Development, Test and Evaluation (DDT&E) while still accommodating each end-item’s functionality. In addition to DDT&E, there are other cost and operations benefits to commonality such as reduced logistics, simplified infrastructure integration and with inter-operability, improved safety and simplified training. These benefits are not without a cost. Some habitats are sub-optimized giving up unique attributes for the benefit of the overall architecture and because the first item sets the course for those to follow, rapidly developing technology may be excluded. The small habitats within the EMC include the pressurized crew cabins for the ascent vehicle, rover, Mars-moon taxi and exploration vehicle. In addition, the scope of commonality is broadened to include a precursor cis-lunar Exploration Augmentation Module (EAM) and the logistic elements supporting both the EAM and Mars surface operations. Together, these amount to over 20 flight vehicles. The approach to maximizing commonality combines not only the physical and functional characteristics of the habitats, but also methods of acquisition and management spanning the multi-decade exploration campaign. The paper presents a method of quantifying the cost benefits of developing common habitats. First, based on the campaign schedule, the time for developing individual habitat is identified. Then this is compared to strategy that combines all habitat requirements into a core for a single DDT&E with follow-on delta development for each end item. The savings as a result of overall program schedule compression is measured using analogous DDT&E and recurring costs escalated to a common year dollar. In order to demonstrate a workable common solution, three design/analysis products are shown. These include a commonality analysis tool derived from the master equipment list for each habitat, a cost analysis tool and representative configurations that validate the initial common core tailored to each vehicle.",6,2015-01-01,Conference Paper,NA

This concept of operations opens the door for a fully reusable Mars transportation system from cis-lunar space to a Mars parking orbit and back. This paper explores the reuse of in-space transportation systems, with a focus on the propulsion systems. It begins by examining why reusability should be pursued and defines reusability in space-flight context. A range of functions and enablers associated with preparing a system for reuse are identified and a vision for reusability is proposed that can be advanced and implemented as new capabilities are developed. Following this, past reusable spacecraft and servicing capabilities, as well as those currently in development are discussed. Using the Hybrid transportation architecture as an example, an assessment of the degree of reusability that can be incorporated into the architecture with current capabilities is provided and areas for development are identified that will enable greater levels of reuse in the future.

Multiple techniques and practices to minimize psychological stress that may suppress immune system and reduce resistance to cancer, are presented and compared. Conclusions are drawn upon results of those comparisons and a multidisciplinary design concept is proposed to be applied both in long-duration human space exploration missions and in radioactive environment on Earth.",0,2014-01-01,Conference Paper,NA
84938057392,Low mass radiation shielding for a manned interplanetary mission,Fries D.,NA,"Proceedings of the International Astronautical Congress, IAC",1,NA,165-175,NA,"In the context of the Mars Society International Student Design Competition the possible dangers and counter measures to radiation hazards during interplanetary transit have been evaluated. The term space radiation mainly describes particle radiation, which is very dangerous for humans if certain doses are exceeded. The galactic cosmic radiation (GCR) consists of highly energetic particles (up to several TeV) but the fluxes are low. Therefore, GCR is only of concern, if long-term missions are planned such as manned flights to Mars with a time frame of over 1.5 years. Because of the high energies, GCR cannot be shielded effectively without a significant increase in weight, caused by additional shielding material or active shielding systems. Solar activity is the source of the second kind of space radiation. Solar particle events (SPE) increase the radiative fluxes by orders of magnitude but only possess energies of a few hundred MeV. This kind of radiation can and has to be shielded effectively since it can result in lethal doses within a short amount of time (minutes to hours). Therefore, storm shelters are typically used, which possess a high material density and hydrogen content. Using a smart design approach of protective elements, a solar storm-shelter is created with a minimum increase in overall system weight. Thus, the radiation exposure is kept below the prescribed lifetime doses for astronauts. Since the habitat mass for Trans-Mars-Injection is very limited, the highest level of synergy between different subsystems and radiation protection is necessary. The greatest benefits can be achieved through a smart system layout and recycling. The usage of a system that produces tiles from waste to fortify the shielding is proposed. Furthermore, process water, feces, food and wet wipes can be arranged to result in protective curtains. Polyethylene, due to its high hydrogen content, is a promising material to decrease radiation doses. Several propositions are made for its usage. The overall goals are the effective sheltering of the crew from radiation while keeping the increase in mass at a minimum. Both are key requirements to achieve interplanetary manned space flight with currently available technology.",0,2014-01-01,Conference Paper,NA
84937923876,Cooperative scenarios for human exploration beyond Low Earth Orbit,Battat J.,NA,"Proceedings of the International Astronautical Congress, IAC",2,NA,1091-1104,NA,"There is an international need to define a concrete strategy and plan to implement that strategy for the initial human exploration missions beyond Low Earth Orbit (LEO). Across all stakeholders, there is a growing consensus that the long term objective of global human space exploration is the long duration presence of people on the Martian surface. Along the pathway between current activities in LEO and eventual Mars outposts are a variety of preparatory exploration missions and intermediate goals. Over the last decade several different initial steps along these pathways beyond LEO have been proposed. It is important to build international consensus on such a plan soon because future missions require near-term investments for new capabilities with no single nation committing resources to achieve all the steps of an ambitious program on its own. The goal of this work is to enumerate and evaluate scenarios for cooperative missions beyond LEO that achieve incremental development of human exploration capabilities. Towards the goal of generating scenarios for cooperative missions beyond LEO, proposed missions and capabilities from a variety of international actors have been assessed. Presented in this paper are results of a survey of proposed missions and a series of interviews with industry experts knowledgeable about both the technical and geopolitical issues in forging a sustainable path towards Mars. There are four realistic proposals for initial human exploration beyond LEO: a cis-Lunar habitat, asteroid redirect, Mars flyby, and a Lunar surface sortie. In the absence of top-down agreements, such as those governing the International Space Station, that specify partnership responsibilities and privileges, ad-hoc exchanges within individual development projects or for specific mission capabilities is most likely to facilitate international cooperation in the coming years. General LEO transportation logistics and habitation functions are shared by many actors and allow for exchange of services and utilization of exploration assets if designed into the critical path. Given the early stage of readiness, it is possible that subsystem-level coordination could be pursued for an advanced habitation element. Other technologies are either niche (robotics) or have national sensitivities (in-space propulsion) that make them less desirable for subsystem-level coordination.",0,2014-01-01,Conference Paper,NA

In this context, this paper examines how to design a low cost mission, using the natural dynamics for Station integration, crew rotations, cargo delivery and disposal. Preliminary studies lead us to select a Halo orbit around EML2 to locate the space station. Then, the entire trajectory, from the selection of the departure Low Earth Obit to the rendez-vous strategy in EML2, was analyzed with several possible transfer types (direct, indirect, lunar flyby or weak stability boundary). Actually, optimization criteria strongly depend on the mission phase. For instance, when crew transit is considered, mission duration has to be minimized, while in the case of cargo transportation, we rather seek to optimize the global delta-v. This paper presents the results (in term of duration and cost) obtained for the two strategies we selected: lunar flybys for the crew and weak stability boundaries trajectories for cargo. We carefully considered the constraints for rendez-vous in EML2 and evaluated their impact on the performances. Moreover, we assessed the impacts of the model selection (ephemeris, four bodies versus restricted circular three bodies problem.). The main contribution of this project lies in the global optimization of the entire mission from LEO to EML2 and return with regards to two criteria (mission duration and delta-v), with a focus on the rendez-vous feasibility in EML2.",0,2014-01-01,Conference Paper,NA

In order to effectively reduce the adverse impact of initial state errors and parameter uncertainties during Mars atmospheric entry and then improve entry navigation accuracy, an innovative high-precision integrated navigation algorithm for Mars entry is developed based on a modified multiple model adaptive estimation (MMAE) in this paper. First, a six degree-of-freedom (DOF) Mars entry dynamics model is derived based on the angular velocity outputs of a gyro, which can be more complete and accurate description of the state variables of an entry vehicle than the traditional three DOF dynamics models. Second, both the accelerometer outputs and radiometric measurements are adopted as the navigation observations embedded to Kalman filter bank to perform state estimation and suppress the measurement noise. Finally, a new modified multiple model adaptive estimation algorithm with exponential decay terms is proposed to overcome the inherent drawback of classical MMAE and then further improve navigation accuracy.

84901285565,"Planning strategies for mars (analog) missions: Real-time, 3-days-in-advance and 1-day-in-advance planning",Hettrich S.,NA,"13th International Conference on Space Operations, SpaceOps 2014",NA,NA,NA,NA,"The Austrian Space Forum OeWF conducts Mars analog missions with varying location, length and complexity, which include analog astronauts using space suit simulators who conduct a variety of experiments. As well as the scientific and technological benefits gained from these missions, the Flight Plan Team (FPT) focuses on testing different planning strategies for planetary (analog) missions. As the missions tend to involve large numbers of participants worldwide and have high demands regarding experiment time and outcome, they provide a suitable training ground for activity planning and scheduling. Over the course of three missions we applied three different strategies in order to study their overall performance: real-time planning, 3-days-in-advance planning and 1-day-in-advance planning for the OeWF analog missions Dachstein 2012, MARS2013 and World Space Week 2013, respectively. For human planetary missions beyond the Moon, delays in crew-ground communications will rule out real-time planning. The described 1-day and 3-day-in-advanceplanning strategies address this difficulty. For robotic missions, decisions in critical circumstances can be postponed and no lives are at risk, whereas human planetary exploration may require short reaction times and cannot await a response. Complete preplanning is not feasible for manned missions due to their complexity. Additionally, health and safety requirements as well as feedback and interactions, e.g. regarding human-based in-situ decisions on mapping or experiment locations, make complete pre-planning not applicable. Instead, the situation requires detailed advance planning that allows for feedback for mission optimization while giving the astronauts the necessary authority and experiment knowledge to apply autonomous, instantaneous changes to the schedule where necessary. To simulate this situation, an artificial time-delay of 10 minutes in each direction was applied after an initial preparation phase for one of the three analog missions, MARS2013. The remaining two missions have no time-delay. We compare the three planning strategies - realtime, 1-day, 3-days-in-advance - and discuss their implementation together with mission specific advantages and disadvantages: real-time planning allows for instantaneous changes authorized by the Flight Director, but also leads to increased unnecessary changes. These are reduced by advance-planning. Because the request for changes in the activity schedule is restricted to 1 (3) days before, the planning process can be made smoother. However, all crew members have to first adjust to this method. A new challenge with advance planning is that the field crew has to be able to make decisions about changing the activity schedule by themselves. This applies to changes in personnel or activities for health and safety reasons or when equipment is unavailable. The decisions regarding activity changes have to be based on knowledge; this increased level of information has to be carefully prepared. If an experiment cannot be carried out and a replacement has to be determined by the crew, they require knowledge of the region, the requirements and resources and of the priority of the activities planned for the day. By optimizing the planning strategy for analog missions, we prepare an increasingly sophisticated planning strategy for future manned missions to Mars.",5,2014-01-01,Conference Paper,NA

Therefore, construction of a sustainable interplanetary transportation network, a Mars-based resource management system and a hazard management system should be considered. In addition, new technologies such as a fully regenerative environmental control and life support system (ECLSS), Mars in-situ resource utilization (ISRU) and advanced propulsion systems (APS) are very important. Hence, the logistics system constructed in this research considers not only mission requirements, such as human transfer time and stay time, but also available technology levels and required safety levels. As a result of the simulation of the logistics system, the required initial mass in low earth orbits (IMLEO) to operate the Mars base is approximately 370 t/year with current technologies. However, the IMLEO decreases to approximately 90-140 t/year using a nuclear light bulb engine or water extraction on Mars.

Recently, a human mission to a near Earth asteroid (NEA) has also been included as a ""deep space precursor"" to an orbital mission of Mars before a landing is attempted. In his ""post-Apollo"" Integrated Space Program Plan (1970 - 1990), Wernher von Braun, proposed a reusable NTPS to deliver cargo and crew to the Moon to establish a lunar base initially before sending human missions to Mars. The NTR was selected because it was a proven technology capable of generating both high thrust and high specific impulse (Isp ~900 s) - twice that of today's best chemical rockets. During the Rover and NERVA programs, twenty rocket reactors were designed, built and successfully ground tested. These tests demonstrated the (1) thrust levels; (2) high fuel temperatures; (3) sustained operation; (4) accumulated lifetime; and (5) restart capability needed for an affordable in-space transportation system. In NASA's Mars Design Reference Architecture (DRA) 5.0 study, the ""Copernicus"" crewed NTR Mars transfer vehicle used three 25 klbf ""Pewee"" engines - the smallest and highest performing engine tested in the Rover program. Smaller lunar transfer vehicles - consisting of a NTPS with three ~16.7 klbf ""SNRE-class"" engines, an in-line propellant tank, plus the payload - can be delivered to LEO using a 70 t to LEO upgraded SLS, and can support reusable cargo delivery and crewed lunar landing missions. The NTPS can play an important role in returning humans to the Moon to stay by providing an affordable in-space transportation system that can allow initial lunar outposts to evolve into settlements capable of supporting commercial activities. Over the next decade collaborative efforts between NASA and private industry could open up new exploration and commercial opportunities for both organizations. With efficient NTP, commercial habitation and crew delivery systems, a ""mobile cislunar research station"" can transport crews to small NEAs delivered to the E-ML2 point. Also possible are week-long ""lunar tourism"" missions that can carry passengers into lunar orbit for sightseeing (and plenty of picture taking), then return them to Earth orbit where they would re-enter and land using a small reusable lifting body based on NASA's HL-20 design.

Self-deployable habitats will mitigate construction safety risks and reduce costs due to their subsystems coupling and compact transportation size. Robotic construction integrated into architecture is currently at a very low level of technology readiness. The understanding of self-constructing and fully self-sustainable habitats for space also provides a knowledge base for terrestrial applications. The potential of SHEE in terrestrial applications lies in the support and protection of humans exposed to natural disasters. The utilization of rapidly self-deployable habitats that do not require any infrastructure for their operation may become an essential part of a post-disaster management. The paper will show case studies for such deployable habitats. Further, it will examine the necessary ingredients for designing and constructing self-deployable autonomous habitats on moon, Mars and in extreme terrestrial environments.

The habitat will feature a robotic deployment mechanism, power generation system and a life support system. The test-bed will be conceived as a temporary living module for two people. The folding capability of the habitat will allow interdisciplinary research and tests of various technologies in different analogues in Europe and worldwide.

Once extracted, the sample is transferred to the Rover on-board scientific instrumentation for analysis. The key element for the acquisition of the samples is the ExoMars Drill, based upon a multi-rod concept. At the present time, a preliminary Engineering Qualification Model (pre-EQM) of the ExoMars Drill has been manufactured and integrated. Such a model includes both parts that are already at qualification level (namely the the mechanics) and parts at commercial level that will be upgraded to EQM level later on (i.e. the actuators and box structure). The Drill pre-EQM, commanded by an Engineering Model Drill Control Unit (electronics and software), has recently undergone a thorough test campaign, both in Laboratory and in Mars-Like environment. At the time being, two ""vertical survey"" to 2m depth have been executed in laboratory conditions, while a test campaign in Mars-Like has recently been completed. The ""vertical survey"", one of the mission objectives of the ExoMars Drill, consists in drilling the soil down to a depth of two meters whilst collecting samples of the soil/regolith every 50cm, namely at 0m, 0.5m, 1m, 1.5m and 2m depth. As stated above, an intense test campaign in laboratory conditions has been carried out completing two complete vertical surveys in suitable stratigraphies composed of a variety of Mars-analogue materials. Ten samples have been collected throughout this test and the two meters depth has been reached twice and relevant results are presented in this paper. In the last months (April-June 2013), a very important step forward has been taken: to perform deep drilling and sampling (up to 2m depth) in Mars-Like conditions. This environmental test campaign has been executed utilizing a dedicated facility designed and built at CISAS (University of Padova) in order to reproduce Mars-Like conditions in terms of temperatures, atmospheric composition and pressure. The facility is also able to host a dedicated sample container, filled with Mars-analogue rocks and regolith/sands, capable to reproduce the temperatures of the Mars soil itself.

84904599834,Habitability of manned vehicles: The impact of human factors on future long duration human space exploration missions en route to mars,Ferraioli G.,NA,"Proceedings of the International Astronautical Congress, IAC",1,NA,1-10,NA,"Placing humans in space for a long duration mission beyond Earth's neighborhood implies the design of a highly complex system to travel, live and work safely in the hostile environment of deep space. In order to identify all the constraints from both engineering and human sides, a meticulous system engineering approach has to be followed and the human sciences, including incorporation of ideas from artists, ergonomists and psychologists, have to be integrated in the very early stages of the mission design. Given the future human spaceflight destinations en route to Mars, i.e. deep space-habitats at Earth-Moon Lagrange (EML) points, lunar bases and asteroids, the main psychosocial and psychological issues are concerning the adverse effects of prolonged co-living and co-working in small groups, under conditions of confinement and isolation. With the aim to study the impact on habitability of latent and overt stressors, yielded by spaceflight missions, and to gain a deeper understanding of crew productivity and reliability, in socially risky situations and extreme environments, we conducted a survey involving participants from naturalistic space analogues (Antarctic settings, caves extended exploration, remote sea-based oil drilling platforms, remote military outposts, drone pilots, Mars 520). The participants completed a questionnaire aiming to examine the effects of psychological, interpersonal and environmental factors on individual well-being and team performance. The data collected revealed the criticality of the several space analogues and helped to quantify the general statement which claims that no place on Earth can reproduce the exact extreme space conditions. The results suggest that the design of habitats and habitable structures for spaceships, extra-terrestrial planetary surfaces and analogue environments should include as many private crew areas as possible. The implementation of a continuous ""in-flight"" psychological support from the ground also appears to be a primary need. In addition, job specifications should be more team-work oriented, in order to avoid creating unwanted moments of isolation. Several other countermeasures are proposed for a successful integration of the human factors subsystem in the early mission planning. Finally, the paper suggests to focus on spin-off for terrestrial applications as further studies: our investigation found a strong synergy with the automation of dependent people with reduced mobility.",0,2013-01-01,Conference Paper,NA

The main reason to go to Mars is not just 'exploration' but to expand life beyond the Earth. Mars ascent vehicles will be dangerous and extremely expensive to develop, making a round-trip mission unaffordable in today's economic climate. More importantly, the return leg of a journey simply does not contribute to the goal of expanding civilization beyond the Earth. Exploration and scientific investigations would be only secondary goals until the base is firmly established and safe. The sequence of deployment is: after an (optional) human sortie to a near-Earth asteroid, human sorties would go to Mars orbit, Phobos, or Deimos. For safety, the crew would not land immediately. Instead, from this orbital outpost, the crew would control the deployment, assembly, and testing of base modules on the surface of Mars using teleoperated robotics, or avatars. When sufficient fuel, air, and water are stockpiled at the Mars surface base, two settlers descend from Mars orbit to the surface base. The crew will concentrate on food growth, repair, and manufacture of simple plastic components for greenhouses. After some years to stockpile food and bootstrap manufacturing capability, additional crew members would arrive who could then concentrate on scientific investigations. This study draws heavily from the Mars Homestead Project designs by the Mars Foundation, but adapted for minimal size crew, automated/teleoperated assembly, and a much slower, more economical build-up. Our conclusion: given the uncertain funding for future heavy lift launch vehicles, this method of quickly sending two people to grow food and manufacture materials and devices on Mars may be the only way we can keep people in space in our generation. © 2012 by Mars Foundation.",2,2012-12-01,Conference Paper,NA

On planetary surfaces, pressurized human habitable volumes will require a means to carry heavy equipment between various locations within the volume of the habitat, regardless of the partial gravity (Earth, moon, Mars, etc). On the NASA Habitat Demonstration Unit (HDU), a vertical cylindrical volume, it was determined that a variety of heavy items would need to be carried back and forth from deployed locations to the General Maintenance Work Station (GMWS) when in need of repair, and other equipment may need to be carried inside for repairs, such as rover parts and other external equipment. The vertical cylindrical volume of the HDU lent itself to a circular overhead track and hoist system that allows lifting of heavy objects from anywhere in the habitat to any other point in the habitat interior. In addition, the system is able to hand off lifted items to other material handling systems through the side hatches, such as through an airlock.

This paper details the design of a novel robotic explorer that would open access to these previously inaccessible locales, such as Martian crater walls where evidence of salty water was recently detected, Lunar polar craters where evidence of water ice was detected, and Lunar and Martian lava tubes for future habitability. The Axel rover is a two-wheeled robot capable of rappelling down steep (even vertical) slopes supported by a tether. The DuAxel rover is comprised of two Axel vehicles docked to a central module. Unrestricted by tether length, this four-wheeled system would be capable of driving long distances from a safe landing zone to the extreme terrain of interest. Once in the vicinity of terrain in which the tether would be required, one of the Axel rovers could undock from the central chassis and rappel downslope. The other Axel and central chassis would remain topside to act as an anchor and to provide line of site to Earth (for communications) and the Sun (for energy). As the detached Axel descends into the area of interest, it would receive power and relays data through conductors in its tether. Each Axel would carry a suite of instruments in a bay that would be tucked inside the wheels. Because of the novel configuration of Axel's major degrees of freedom, these instruments could be precisely pointed at targets at any desired downslope spatial separation. These instruments could then be deployed into close proximately to the ground by means of a simple mechanism, allowing for detailed study of the strata on the slope. Axel could accommodate a host of instruments, including a microscopic imager, infrared spectrometers, thermal probes, and sample collection devices. This paper will describe the design of both the latest generation of Axel and DuAxel systems and their instrument/sampling mechanisms.

The tool was developed as part of the Integrated Mars Sample Acquisition and Handling (IMSAH) architecture allowing for end to end sample capture and caching as it relates to the proposed Mars Sample Return (MSR) campaign. The key element of the tool design, as it pertains to the IMSAH architecture, is the ability to drill and capture rock cores directly into a sample tube. In doing so, the sample tube becomes the handling element within the IMSAH sample handling chain significantly reducing the possibility of sample contamination and uncertainty related to handling a sample of unknown geometry. In order to validate the tool's unit level functionality a series of verification and validation tests have been performed utilizing a rock test suite that encompasses a variety of rock types that are analogous to Martian rocks and have been used in the past to qualify Martian surface sampling hardware. The results of the testing have shown the tool can successfully generate, fracture, and capture rock cores within a sample tube for all of the rocks within the proposed test suite. Additionally, the tool does so while maintaining torque margins of no less than 50% for all mechanisms with an average power consumption of no greater than 90W and a tool mass of less than 6kg. © 2012 IEEE.",9,2012-05-22,Conference Paper,NA

Systems for Earth analogue testing, such as the Habitat Demonstration Unit developed by NASA and evaluated in recent Desert RATS field tests, have been tasked with representing everything from Mars and lunar habitats to microgravity habitats for use on missions to near-Earth objects or long-duration human servicing missions. Launch vehicles are no better known than destinations at the moment, and potential habitat designs range from 4.5 meter diameters for existing expendable launch vehicles to 7-10 meter diameters for speculative future heavy-lift vehicles. This paper attempts to take a step back from the plethora of habitat point designs under consideration, and examines human space habitats based on parametric models of size, mass, and function, with a primary goal of reaching an informed decision on the degree to which an Earth analogue habitat in full Earth gravity can meaningfully represent habitats in substantial reduced gravities (moon, Mars) or in microgravity (NEOs, cislunar space, Martian moons). Using basic geometry and physics, this paper identifies a standard habitat element as a right circular cylinder with ellipsoidal endcaps, and assesses pressurized and habitable volumes and surface areas in various configurations. This changes based on the need to provide standing head height in macrogravity, and the equivalent head height for a neutral body posture in microgravity. This leads to differences between vertical and horizontal configurations of habitat layouts, which are extended from geometric expressions of volumes and areas to mass estimating relationships for habitat overall mass based on geometric configuration. Simple physical models are created to understand the fundamentals of human motion in reduced gravities, such as increase in jumping capability, inadvertent free-flight due to excess energy in standard locomotion, and alternate designs for stairs, ladders, and other systems for moving between vertically stacked decks in alternate gravitational environments. This is one of the primary areas of fundamental difference between reduced gravity and microgravity, as energy requirements for climbing become meaningless in microgravity. Finally, the paper begins the deliberation in the effectiveness of available and potential Earth analogue environments for higher fidelity assessment of habitat functionality and the development of a validated data base on reduced gravity design rules. While the U.S. space program has learned a great deal about microgravity habitat and workstation design in the last 30 years of shuttle operations, we are still at the beginning in terms of long-term life on the Moon or Mars. © 2012 by University of Maryland Space Systems Laboratory.",0,2012-01-01,Conference Paper,NA

This paper gives an overview on the MB10 design and has its primary focus on the deployment of the inflatable structure. The deployment simulations show the final inflated shape of the MB10 concept on Mars from an un-inflated initial shape on Earth. The deployment strategy, simulations and rigidization techniques are discussed to provide a conceptual solution for large inflatable components of the MB10 habitat. Further applications of secondary inflatable smart structures are presented as well. These secondary structures are self deploying at the Martian ambient pressure which results in low storage volume and mass.

The first was built on the assumption, as in previous menu development efforts for closed ecological systems, that the food system would be vegetarian, whereas the second menu introduced shelf-stable, prepackaged meat and entrée items from the current International Space Station (ISS) food system. Both menus delivered an average of 3000 cal daily but the macronutrient proportions resulted in an excess of carbohydrates and dietary fiber per mission nutritional recommendations. Generally, the individual recipes comprising both menus were deemed acceptable by internal sensory panel (average overall acceptability=7.4). The incorporation of existing ISS entrée items did not have a significant effect on the acceptability of the menus. In a final comparison, the food system upmass, or the amount of food that is shipped from the Earth, increased by 297 kg with the addition of prepackaged entrées to the menu. However, the addition of the shipped massed was counterbalanced by a 864 kg reduction in required crops.

It is suggested to use the largest possible diameter such that the ballistic coefficient is minimized and the lift to drag ratio is kept small. The maneuvers for the descent and landing are then simplified and the risks are minimized. The scenario has been modified to cope with the new constraints. Different options have been taken into account. It is possible to land a small Mars ascent vehicle or to reuse the habitat lander for Mars ascent. All options perform as well as the others for the criterion of the initial mass in low Earth orbit. However, reusing the habitat lander allows a significant reduction of the size of the Earth return vehicle, which otherwise requires a huge launching capability. © 2012 Elsevier Ltd.

84880607591,Facility layout optimization of planetary industrial sites,Casler J.,NA,AIAA SPACE Conference and Exposition 2011,NA,NA,NA,NA,"Despite wide recognition that lunar bases are to be engaged in significant industrial operations, such as resource extraction and propellant production, to date, authors discussing space basing have not delineated location and layout design considerations as found in the processing plant and mining literature discussed. This paucity may be due to several factors. The body of knowledge of planetary basing is not as rich in empirical or experiential evidence nor as lengthy as for mining and process plants. Additionally, most considerations of lunar or martian bases have been more oriented to small temporary science and exploration outposts rather than viewing the bases as production systems. Consequently, there has been little attention to the production processes and the optimization of base layout for operational productivity, efficiency, safety, and cost. The purpose of this paper is to report preliminary efforts to assess potential siting issues for lunar bases to address this shortfall. This study attempted to frame the optimization problem posed by the set of variables and constraints and the relationships among those variables relative to operations in the lunar environment. Although a literature survey examined candidate optimization approaches, there was no attempt in this effort to select an approach or to develop an optimization scheme. The results suggest that while terrestrial analogs of lunar sites are insufficiently developed industrially to offer much insight, there is a substantial volume of literature concerning terrestrial mining and process plants to offer excellent analogs. In considering the terrestrial processing plant and mining operation as analogs for future planetary industrial operations and projecting to the lunar surface, several conclusions may be drawn. First, in the context of an optimization problem, the analogs suggest that several objective functions may be relevant. Among these is an emphasis on safety, most significantly represented by EVA safety, that should be reflected in the problem objective statement. Such statements influence layout by maximizing adjacencies between human-attended units, where possible, and by requiring pressurized and shielded passageways where not. A preliminary list of thirteen factors is offered for consideration for lunar base layout design. Additionally, common manufacturing facility layout concerns and optimization approaches are available and appear promising. A simple example of the application of a common layout methodology, i.e., Systematic Layout Planning, is developed for a notional lunar industrial site. This simplistic, well-used, graphical method can offer a better rationalized approach than seen in the literature to date.

84864101940,Development and demonstration of sustainable surface infrastructure for moon/mars exploration,Sanders G.,NA,"62nd International Astronautical Congress 2011, IAC 2011",2,NA,1642-1647,NA,"For long-term human exploration of the Moon and Mars to be practical, affordable, and sustainable, future missions must be able to identify and utilize resources at the site of exploration. The ability to characterize, extract, processes, and separate products from local material, known as In-Situ Resource Utilization (ISRU), can provide significant reductions in launch mass, logistics, and development costs while reducing risk through increased mission flexibility and protection as well as increased mission capabilities in the areas of power and transportation. Making mission critical consumables like propellants, fuel cell reagents and life support gases, as well as in-situ crew/hardware protection and energy storage capabilities can significantly enhance robotic and human science and exploration missions, however other mission systems need to be designed to interface with and utilize these in-situ developed products and services from the start or the benefits will be minimized or eliminated. This requires a level of surface and transportation system development coordination not typically utilized during early technology and system development activities. An approach being utilized by the US National Aeronautics and Space Administration and the Canadian Space Agency has been to utilize joint analogue field demonstrations to focus technology development activities to demonstrate and integrate new and potentially 'game changing' mission critical capabilities that would enable an affordable and sustainable surface infrastructure for lunar and Mars robotic and human exploration. Two analogue field tests performed in November 2008 and February 2010 demonstrated first generation capabilities for lunar resource prospecting, exploration site preparation, and oxygen extraction from regolith while initiating integration with mobility, science, fuel cell power, and propulsion disciplines. A third analogue field test currently planned for June 2012 will continue and expand the fidelity and integration of these surface exploration and infrastructure capabilities while adding Mars exploration technologies, improving remote operations and control of hardware, and promoting the use of common software, interfaces, & standards for control and operation for surface exploration and science. The next field test will also attempt to include greater involvement by industry, academia, and other countries/space agencies. This paper will provide an overview of the development and demonstration approach utilized to date, the results of the previous two ISRU-focused field analogue tests in Hawaii, and the current objectives and plans for the 3 rd international Hawaii analogue field test.

84864088486,"Carbon dioxide removal system for closed loop atmosphere revitalization, candidate sorbents screening and test results",Mattox E.,NA,"62nd International Astronautical Congress 2011, IAC 2011",1,NA,330-337,NA,"Due to the difficulty and expense it costs to resupply manned-spacecraft habitats, a goal is to create a closed loop atmosphere revitalization system, in which precious commodities such as oxygen, carbon dioxide, and water are continuously recycled. Currently, the crew on the International Space Station (ISS) uses a 4-bed molecular sieve packed with zeolite crystals enclosed in a clay binder and silica gel as the carbon dioxide removal system. The water and carbon dioxide adhere to the zeolite crystals by adsorption and are regenerated by desorption. The benefit of the zeolites is that they can be continuously re-used. However, there are two major drawbacks to the current system; the first being that the fluidic motion between the pellets generates fines of dust that contaminate equipment on the space station, and the second is that the clay binder is a poor thermal conductor, limiting the escape of heat generated from the heat of adsorption and adversely requiring a large amount of energy to regenerate the material by desorption. Our aim is to test other sorbents for their capacity for future spacecraft missions, such as on the Orion spacecraft, or possibly lunar or Mars mission habitats to see if they would be better than the zeolite sorbents on the 4-bed molecular sieve. Some of the materials being tested are currently used for other industry applications. Studying these sorbents for their specific spacecraft application is different than for applications on earth because in space, there are certain power, mass, and volume limitations that are not as critical on Earth. In manned-spaceflight missions, the sorbents are exposed to a much lower volume fraction of CO 2 than on Earth. For example, on space station, there is a 0.6% volume of CO 2, where as these materials are exposed to 12-15% CO 2 from smokestacks from coal-fired plants. Honeywell UOP OXYSIV MDX 20x50 was tested for its CO 2 capacity in an atmosphere like that of the ISS. Breakthrough tests were run to establish the capacities of these materials at a partial pressure of CO 2 that is seen on the ISS. This paper discusses experimental results from benchmark materials, such as results previously obtained from tests on zeolite 5A, and the fore mentioned candidate materials for the Carbon Dioxide Removal Assembly (CDRA) system.",0,2011-12-01,Conference Paper,NA

The aim of the game is to increase public interest and awareness of space exploration as well as providing players with a learning experience. A computer game is the perfect medium through which to accomplish these goals, as it provides the opportunity for players to experience events from a first-person perspective. This makes it easier for the player to relate to, and understand, the topic. In The Simonauts, the player takes on the role of one of six astronauts, or ""Simonauts"", living on a Mars base during the first manned mission to the Red Planet. The goal of the game is to stay alive for the duration of the mission, and to gain as many ""Mars Knowledge"" points as possible. Resource management is at the core of the game. The Simonaut must try to survive, i.e. eat, sleep, exercise, etc., with the limited time and resources that are available to the player. In addition to that, the characters perform research, interact with other Simonauts and handle contingency situations. No previous knowledge of space, Mars, or science, is required to play, as players learn as they progress through the game. There are many possible paths through which the game can be completed, which means that the game can be played multiple times, with different outcomes. The game demonstrates to the player, in a simplified and condensed form, some of the main issues of living and working in space. It also highlights differences and similarities between living on Mars and on Earth. The Mars mission scenario has been inspired by the latest NASA Mars Design Reference Mission Architecture. In-game specifies such as resource management are based on current experience and knowledge of human space missions. This paper presents a game concept, which is the basis for further development and programming of the game itself. It describes the gameplay, provides guidelines for the graphical user interface, and describes the core game mechanics. The paper also provides suggestions for further development of the game concept by recommending several extended features. Copyright ©2011 by Katarina Eriksson.

It is clear that sooner or later, humanity will take this adventure. Arguably the most important aspect to consider for the success of such an endeavour is the human element. The safety of the crew throughout a Martian mission is a top priority for all space agencies. Therefore, such a mission should not take place until all the risks have been fully understood and mitigated. A mission to Mars presents unique human and technological challenges in terms of isolation, confinement, autonomy, reliance on mission control, communication delays and adaptation to different gravity levels. Analogue environments provide the safest way to simulate these conditions, mitigate the risks and evaluate the effects of long-term space travel on the crew. Martian Feeling is one of nine analogue studies, from the Mars Analogue Path (M AP) report [1], proposed by the TP Analogue group of ISU Masters class 2010. It is an integrated analogue study which simulates the psychological, physiological and operational conditions that an international, six-person, mixed gender crew would experience on a mission to Mars. Set both onboard the International Space Station (ISS) and on Earth, the Martian Feeling study will perform a ""dress rehearsal"" of a mission to Mars. The study proposes to test both human performance and operational procedures in a cost-effective manner. Since Low Earth Orbit (LEO) is more accessible than other space-based locations, an analogue studies in LEO would provide the required level of realism to a simulated transit mission to Mars. The sustained presence of microgravity and other elements of true spaceflight are features of LEO that are neither currently feasible nor possible to study in terrestrial analogue sites. International collaboration, economics, legal and ethical issues were considered when the study was proposed. As an example of international collaboration, the ISS would demonstrate an effective model for an international effort to send humans to Mars. The proposed starting date is the year 2017, before the planned retirement of the ISS, which is currently scheduled for 2020.",1,2011-08-01,Conference Paper,NA

Additionally, as humans reach to explore the moon and Mars, advanced vehicles and extraterrestrial bases will rely on life support systems that feature in-situ resource utilization to minimize launch weight and enhance mission capability. An obvious goal is the development of advanced systems that meet the requirements of both mission scenarios to reduce development costs by deploying common modules. A high pressure oxygen generating assembly (HPOGA) utilizing a high differential pressure (HDP) water electrolysis cell stack can provide a recharge capability for the high pressure oxygen storage tanks on-board the ISS independently of the Space Shuttle as well as offer a pathway for advanced life support equipment for future manned space exploration missions. After completing a preliminary system study of the HPOGA, two areas for concentrated development to mitigate program risk were identified: increasing the oxygen output level of the HDP cell from 2000 psig to 3000 psig, and evaluating the system safety and reliability requirements for high pressure oxygen, particularly as they pertain to the design of the electrolysis cell stack.

Costs are addressed by reduced launch mass, re-usable in-space transportation to Mars, and minimizing development costs. Design principles are: electric propulsion and propellant depots at destinations to minimize launch mass, re-usable inspace transportation, use launchers that have other customers ... a launch capability of 40 t. with 6.5-meter diameter fairing was assumed ... include support capabilities at destination depots to improve efficiency, reliability and safety; target eventual permanent presence. A representative sequence of missions is given, with increasing capability. Mission design technical factors are described, including uses of electric propulsion that do not impose excessive trip time penalties, and options for permanent human presence without ""gaps"" between missions.

84881246562,An analog roadmap to mars: Recommendations for policymakers and space agencies,Zhang G.L.,NA,AIAA SPACE Conference and Exposition 2010,NA,NA,NA,NA,"With the recent cancellation of the NASA Constellation program, there has been an apparent shift of focus from manned missions undertaken by a single nation to that of multilateral international cooperation. Thus, it is likely that a future manned mission to Mars will be undertaken by a consortium of international partners, with each nation contributing a specific segment of the project. In order to prepare for such an endeavor, a comprehensive framework of ground and space-based tests must be implemented, both for the purpose of training and for the validation of systems and operational procedures. A comprehensive survey of 50 analog studies was undertaken, selected from the topics of psychology, physiology, robotics, extra-vehicular activities, gravity simulation, life support systems, space architecture and integrated approaches. Critical analog studies have been identified as essential to the preparation of a future manned mission to Mars and these have been organized into a series of discrete, progressive steps. Using this selection of analog studies, a comprehensive analog roadmap has been created, aimed at providing policy makers and space agencies with recommendations for the implementation of a high fidelity analog study program with the end goal of preparing for an international mission to Mars. Particular emphasis has been placed on the international aspects of future manned missions and as a result, the analog roadmap is presented within a framework of multi-national collaboration. In addition, the commercialization aspects of future analog studies have been investigated, with emphasis on possibilities for commercial spin-offs as well as the prospect of offering analog sites as a commercial service. Finally, considerations regarding legal, ethical, and policy issues have been incorporated into the implementation of specific analog studies. © 2010 by International Space University.",1,2010-12-01,Conference Paper,NA
84881227243,Propulsion technology and human space exploration,Strobl W.C.,NA,AIAA SPACE Conference and Exposition 2010,NA,NA,NA,NA,"When people speak of exploring the Moon and Mars as projects for the United States, many move to a reference frame of technologies and systems that were explored in the era of President Kennedy's challenge to go to the Moon. At that time chemical propulsion was adequate to develop systems to successfully transport humans to and from the moon. Thermal nuclear propulsion was required to transfer Humans to Mars with long zero gravity mission times. A launch vehicle much, much larger than Saturn V was required to support the Mars Missions. There have been many advances in technology and enhancements of our knowledge of the Moon and Mars that promise more capable and cost effective achievement of the country's long-term space goals. Since that time, automated spacecraft sent to Mars demonstrated that the atmosphere at Mars can be used for Mars capture by aerobraking and thus reducing the weight of the Mars transfer vehicles and thereby the size of the boosters required. Space Station Freedom identified that long exposure to zero gravity can cause reduction of bone density (i.e. bone decalcification) and weakened muscles (muscle tone loss). Therefore, Mars missions must have relativity short flight times to and from Mars and/or an artificial gravity system included on the vehicle. This year potential large amounts of water and ice were discovered on the lunar surface. Thus rocket propellant, oxygen, water and other elements for a Mars mission could be supplied from bases on the Moon. Initiating a Mars mission from a Lunar altitude orbit would significantly reduce the required earth departure velocity and vehicle thrust-toweight requirements. Developing an Earth Moon infrastructure will reduce the risk and cost for a later human Mars mission. Nuclear electric propulsion technology research has made many advances and potentially promises a propulsion system that could provide a human Mars mission a faster trip, less risk to the astronauts, and a smaller, reusable propulsion system capable of many other missions and self disposal into the Sun. The senior author of this paper has had the unique experience of designing conceptual human Mars propulsion systems in 1962-1965, 1986 -1988 and 2008-2010 using both types of nuclear propulsion as well as chemical propulsion.

The elements of a baseline transportation model are adopted, and within this context, the risk associated with transportation, set up and return from the Mars base is determined as a function of sustaining life functions on the surface. The point where the individual influences of these characteristic risks balance is sought out.

Short term plans to return to the Moon based have been replaced by ambitious plans to create the technology necessary for a sustainable human space exploration with the ultimate goal of putting humans on Mars. Preparing for such an endeavor requires the implementation of a comprehensive framework of ground and space-based studies in so-called analog sites that recreate certain specific aspects of the mission with satisfactory fidelity. These analog studies would benefit development of technology, procedures, and ergonomics, while providing insights to crew psychology and physiology. In spite of the importance of analog studies, current activities are scattered over several countries and insufficiently coordinated. It seems likely that a huge endeavor like a manned mission to Mars needs a strong international partnership.

These lessons will be used as one facet of NASA's preparation to explore, over extended periods of time, the surface of the Moon and Mars as part of the Constellation Program. Over 50 years of extensive traverses in both the Arctic and Antarctic provide a potentially rich source of lessons for future planetary missions under analogous conditions. For both lunar and Mars missions, it is anticipated that both crew and robotic equipment, which could arrive on different vehicles, will land in a fairly benign location. But ""benign"" can also translate into ""uninteresting"" from a scientific or exploration perspective, resulting in the crew exhausting the scientific potential of a particular site before returning to Earth. This is especially true for Mars mission crews who will spend 18 months at a given location. By providing a capability to move long distances across the surface removes the need to risk a landing at a more challenging, but interesting, surface location. The proposed paper summarizes the workshop presentations and discusses several of the key findings or lessons, including: (1) A recognition that NASA's current approach for long duration planetary surface operations has fundamental differences from any of the operational approaches described by the invited speakers. These approaches drive the crew size and skill mix to accomplish basic objectives and, in turn, drive the logistical pyramid needed to support these operations. NASA will review the operational approaches of the organizations represented to understand the differentiating factors. NASA will then decide if it should alter its current approach to surface exploration. (2) There are potential parallels between key characteristics of the systems used for exploration in these environments, such as heated volume as an analog for pressurized volume or energy usage for various activities. NASA will look at these characteristics to identify which could help with preliminary planning and gather raw data from the presenters to model these characteristics. (3) New technologies are being applied and design approaches are being tailored to take advantage of these technologies on both sides. Interactions between these two communities has begun or is expanding to understand how these new technologies are being leveraged: NASA habitation designers are exchanging ideas and approaches with the Antarctic station designers; Antarctic support contractors have put together a list of areas where NASA could benefit from their experience and vice versa; discussions have begun to compare the equipment used for the National Science Foundation (NSF) South Pole Station resupply traverses to identify possibly functional similarities for NASA. © 2010 ASCE.",1,2010-11-29,Conference Paper,NA

These habitats have been built with large similarities to actual planned habitats for first Mars exploration missions. Participation is open to everybody either proposing experimentations or wishing only to participate as a crew member. Participants are from different organizations: Mars Society, Universities, experimenters working with NASA or ESA. The general philosophy of the work conducted is not to do an innovative scientific work on the field but to learn how the scientific work is affected or modified by the simulation conditions. Outside activities are conducted with simulated spacesuits limiting the experimenter abilities. Technology or procedures experimentations are also conducted as well as experimentations on the crew psychology and behaviour. © 2009 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.",1,2010-06-01,Article,NA
73349134987,Some comments on the protection of lunar habitats against damage from meteoroid impacts,Schonberg W.,NA,Journal of Aerospace Engineering,23,1,90-97,10.1061/(ASCE)0893-1321(2010)23:1(90),"The establishment of human habitats on the Moon and on Mars will require protecting them from the hazards of near-Earth and interplanetary space. In addition to solar radiation, another hazard to be faced by these habitats is the damage that can result from the high speed impact of a meteoroid on a critical structural component. Therefore, lunar habitats and their accompanying support facilities need to be designed with adequate levels of protection that will allow them to also withstand the damage that can result from a meteoroid impact. In this paper we discuss some approaches to shielding for lunar habitats, focusing on shielding that is intended primarily to provide protection against meteoroid impacts and on shielding approaches that use resources mined or extracted from the Moon. The Moon's mineralogy is discussed and suggestions are presented for materials and material combinations that can be used to develop shielding for lunar habitats and which are comprised primarily or entirely of lunar materials. Several shielding mechanisms are also presented that could be effective against impacts by meteoroid particles having diameters on the order of that which are likely to strike a fairly large lunar habitat at least one or two times per year. The paper concludes with recommendations for continuing work in optimizing the design of meteoroid shielding for lunar habitats. © 2010 ASCE.",7,2010-01-08,Article,NA

Monitoring the crew habitat becomes more critical in such long term missions, when resupply from earth and return to earth are highly difficult or impossible. It is expected that some of the requirements will be similar to previous space missions. Additional requirements will result from the dusty nature of the lunar or Martian surface. This paper will describe the state of technology development for environmental monitoring of lunar lander and lunar outpost missions, and the state of plans for future missions. © 2010 by the American Institute of Aeronautics and Astronautics, Inc.",3,2010-01-01,Conference Paper,NA

Several example architectures for lunar and Mars exploration and development are presented that use strategic location of propellant depots and solar electric propulsion for their delivery. These architectures reduce launch mass and re-use some or all of the in-space elements. Cost-per-mission reduction factors on the order of two to five are indicated. If combined with a partially re-usable launch system that reduces launch cost by a factor of two, overall reductions approaching an order of magnitude are possible. © 2010 by Gordon Woodcock.",3,2010-01-01,Conference Paper,NA

Primary emphases will highlight influences upon general habitat requirements, constraints upon delivery and construction, and special provisions for safety and hazard interventions. The overall intent is to identify important lessons that can be applied across different settings which present common priorities, issues and challenges. Such environments include future bases on the Moon and Mars, offshore surface andsubmersible facilities, polar research and oil/natural gas exploration stations, military desert operations, and natural and man-made emergency shelters. Important topics of emphasis include the following considerations: Design influences driven by transport to remote sites Environmental influences upon facilities and construction Influences of crew sizes, types of activities and occupancy durations Influences of construction methods and support infrastructures Special safety and emergency response requirements This presentation will draw upon research and design activities at the Sasakawa International Center for Space Architecture (SICSA). Information is also taken from a SICSA-sponsored conference “International Design for Extreme Environments One” (IDEEA-One) at the University of Houston which attracted more than 400 interdisciplinary participants from 12 countries representing diverse professions and environmental settings.

77957948595,The Martian chronicles: Remotely guided diagnosis and treatment in the arctic circle,Otto C.,Appendicitis | Spaceflight | Ultrasound,Surgical Endoscopy,24,9,2170-2177,10.1007/s00464-010-0917-1,"Background: Despite rigorous health screening in astronaut crews, there are a number of conditions that may occur during long duration, exploration class spaceflight. The risk of abdominal conditions requiring surgical intervention is not clear, yet submarine and polar base experiences suggest contingency planning is warranted. While radio communication time delay is only 2 s to the international space station (ISS), a potential Mars mission would necessitate time delays of about 15 min. We sought to demonstrate the feasibility of remote expert guidance of diagnostic ultrasound followed by laparoscopic appendectomy in a simulated Mars environment. Methods: Research was deemed exempt by the institutional review board. A simulated Mars research environment was utilized on Devon Island in the Canadian Arctic. Electronic communications including audio and video were established between the Arctic base and Henry Ford Hospital serving as Mission Control and incorporated the 15-min communications lag into all communication. Ultrasound and laparoscopic capabilities were integrated into communications for remote guidance. Remote guidance methods and technology utilized has been previously published in communication with the ISS. A simulated scenario involving a young female astronaut developing right lower quadrant pain was developed and utilized for this demonstration. An anatomical appendectomy model was utilized for the ultrasound and laparoscopic portions. Reference aids describing background technical aspects were developed. A set of confirmation milestones was used to generate a hard stop and mandated remote review. Results: The simulated appendectomy was successfully pursued on the first attempt with no delays or untoward events. Reference aids were appropriate for non-surgical personnel and hard stops for milestones with remote approval and go ahead were shown to be feasible. The appendicitis was appropriately diagnosed utilizing remote guidance of ultrasonography and the appendix removed laparoscopically using stapled technique with remote guidance as well. Conclusions: We report a successful remote guidance demonstration from a simulated mars environment with clinical control from a terrestrial base utilizing appropriate delay and consistent bandwidth and technology © 2010 Springer Science+Business Media, LLC.",23,2010-01-01,Article,NA
